Thank you.\'a0 Well, thank you very much.\'a0 I\'92m working very hard for you, I will tell you.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 And sometimes you don\'92t make it easy, and I certainly don\'92t make it easy on you.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 And I will continue that tradition, if I might, this morning.\'a0 And, Arthur, I don\'92t know if I agree with you.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 But I don\'92t know if Arthur is going to like what I\'92m going to say.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 But I love listening to you.\'a0 It\'92s really great.\'a0 Thank you very much.\
And thank you, congressmen, for the great job you\'92ve been doing and the relationship and the help.\'a0 You\'92re a warrior.\'a0 Thank you very much.\'a0 And, Kevin, you\'92re a warrior.\'a0 Thank you.\'a0 The job you\'92ve done is incredible.\'a0 It wasn\'92t supposed to be that way.\'a0 A lot of extra work.\'a0 Unnecessary work.\
It\'92s wonderful to be with the thousands of religious believers for the 68th annual National Prayer Breakfast.\'a0 I\'92ve been here from the first one, where I had the privilege of being asked.\'a0 I\'92ve been with you for a long time before then.\'a0 And we\'92ve made tremendous progress.\'a0 Tremendous progress.\'a0 You know what we\'92ve done.\'a0 I don\'92t think anybody has done more than all of us together during these last three years.\'a0 And it\'92s been my honor.\
But this morning, we come together as one nation, blessed to live in freedom and grateful to worship in peace.\'a0 As everybody knows, my family, our great country, and your President, have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people.\'a0 They have done everything possible to destroy us, and by so doing, very badly hurt our nation.\'a0 They know what they are doing is wrong, but they put themselves far ahead of our great country.\
Weeks ago, and again yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, the fortitude, and strength to do what everyone knows was right.\'a0 I don\'92t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.\'a0 Nor do I like people who say, \'93I pray for you,\'94 when they know that that\'92s not so.\
So many people have been hurt, and we can\'92t let that go on.\'a0 And I\'92ll be discussing that a little bit later at the White House.\
We\'92re joined today by two people whose faith inspires us all: our amazing, wonderful friend, Vice President Mike Pence \'97 (applause) \'97 and his wonderful wife, Karen.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Thank you.\'a0 Thank you.\
Thank you to all of our great political leaders out there \'97 so many that I\'92ve been working with so hard over the last three years.\'a0 And we\'92ve accomplished so much.\'a0 And to members of my Cabinet in attendance \'97 Secretary Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, David Bernhardt \'97 (applause) \'97 Gene Scalia, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Dan Brouillette, Betsy DeVos, Robert Wilke, and Administrator Jovita Carranza.\
Joining us \'97 (applause) \'97 for this cherished tradition are a lot of friends in the audience.\'a0 And many, really, have become friends.\'a0 They are political leaders.\'a0 They\'92ve become great friends.\'a0 That\'92s all I get to meet anymore.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 That and the enemies and the allies.\'a0 And we have them all.\'a0 We have allies.\'a0 We have enemies.\'a0 Sometimes the allies are enemies, but we just don\'92t know it.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 But we\'92re changing all that.\'a0 But thank you all, and thank you all for being here.\
I also want to welcome foreign dignitaries from more than 140 countries.\'a0 That\'92s something.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 That\'92s something.\'a0 Everyone here today is united by a shared conviction.\'a0 We know that our nation is stronger, our future is brighter, and our joy is greater when we turn to God and ask him to shed his grace on our lives.\
On Tuesday, I addressed Congress on the state of the Union and the great American comeback.\'a0 That\'92s what it is.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Our country has never done better than it is doing right now.\'a0 Our economy is the strongest it has ever been.\'a0 And for those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will be way up again today.\
According to the latest Gallup poll that just came out a little while ago, a few minutes ago, American satisfaction is at the highest level ever recorded.\'a0 Can you imagine?\'a0 And that\'92s from Gallup \'97 no friend of mine.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Ninety percent of Americans say they are satisfied with their personal lives.\'a0 How about that?\'a0 Isn\'92t that something?\'a0 Just came out today.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 They must have known I was going to be here.\'a0 (Laughter.)\
In everything we do, we are creating a culture that protects freedom, and that includes religious freedom.\'a0 (Applause.)\
As I said on Tuesday in the House Chamber, \'93In America, we don\'92t punish prayer.\'a0 We don\'92t tear down crosses.\'a0 We don\'92t ban symbols of faith.\'a0 We don\'92t muzzle preachers.\'94\'a0 We don\'92t muzzle pastors.\'a0 \'93In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God.\'94\'a0 (Applause.)\
So much of the greatness we have achieved, the mysteries we\'92ve unlocked, and the wonders we\'92ve built, the challenges we\'92ve met, and the incredible heights that we\'92ve reached has come from the faith of our families and the prayers of our people.\
Before America declared independence, patriots in all 13 colonies came together in days of fasting and prayer.\'a0 In the bitter cold of Valley Forge, Washington and his men had no food, no supplies, and very little chance of victory.\'a0 It reminded me a little bit of 2016.\'a0 We had very little chance of victory.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 Except for the people in this room and some others believed we were going to win.\'a0 I believed we were going to win.\'a0 But what they did have was have an unwavering belief that God was with them.\'a0 I believe that too. God is with the people in this room.\
Before a single skyscraper rose up in New York City, thousands of poor American families donated all they could to build the magnificent St. Patrick\'92s Cathedral.\'a0 (Applause.)\
When Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon, he said, \'93Houston, I would like to request a few moments of silence.\'94\'a0 Then, he read from the Bible.\'a0 (Applause.)\
At every stage, our nation\'92s long march for civil rights was inspired, sustained, and uplifted by faith, prayer, and devotion of religious believers.\
To protect faith communities, I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools.\'a0 (Applause.)\
We can also talk about the Johnson Amendment.\'a0 We can talk about Mexico City Policy.\'a0 We\'92ve done a lot.\'a0 But I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of anti-Semitism and bad things about Christianity.\'a0 (Applause.)\
We are upholding the sanctity of life \'97 sanctity of life.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 And we are doing that like nobody has ever done it before from this position.\'a0 You better get out and vote on November 3rd \'97 (laughter) \'97 because you have a lot of people out there that aren\'92t liking what we\'92re doing.\
And we\'92re pursuing medical breakthroughs to save premature babies because every child is a sacred gift from God.\'a0 (Applause.)\
Together, we are building the world\'92s most prosperous and inclusive society.\'a0 We are lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\'a0 We are bringing hope to forgotten communities.\'a0 And more Americans are working today \'97 160 million.\'a0 A little bit short.\'a0 Just a little bit.\'a0 One hundred and sixty million.\'a0 We\'92ve never been even close \'97 than ever before.\'a0 Think of it: More Americans are working today \'97 almost 160 million \'97 than ever before.\'a0 Our unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country.\'a0 (Applause.)\
A more specific number and numbers that you hear me say, if you listen: African American, Asian American, Hispanic American \'97 the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country.\'a0 Women \'97 best in 71 years.\'a0 Sorry.\'a0 We\'92ll have you there soon.\'a0 Soon, it will be \'93historic.\'94\'a0 I have to apologize to the women; it\'92s only 71 years.\
But the best unemployment numbers, we have \'97 we\'92re doing things that nobody thought possible.\'a0 We\'92re setting records that nobody thought achievable.\
And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, which so many people in this room have worked on for so long \'97 (applause) \'97 we passed criminal justice reform into law, and I signed it nine months ago.\
And it\'92s proving more and more that America is indeed a nation that believes in redemption.\'a0 What\'92s happened with prisoners is a miracle.\'a0 Prisoners would come out and nobody would give them a job.\'a0 And oftentimes, most of the time \'97 almost all of the time \'97 they\'92d go back into prison.\'a0 They\'92d get caught doing something bad.\'a0 They had no money.\'a0 They had no hope.\'a0 They had no job.\'a0 Now they\'92re coming out into a booming economy.\'a0 And employers are hiring them, and to a certain extent, maybe because they\'92re having a hard time getting people.\
First time in our country\'92s history, actually, we\'92re running out of people.\'a0 We have plants moving in by the thousands.\'a0 We have car companies coming from Japan and from Germany, from lots of other places, and we need people.\'a0 And employers are hiring prisoners, and they would have never done it, except for what we\'92ve done with criminal justice reform.\'a0 But even before that, because the economy has become so powerful.\
And these prisoners have done an incredible job.\'a0 The employers are saying, \'93Why didn\'92t I do this 20 years ago?\'94\
So it\'92s an incredible thing what\'92s happening to people that are given a second chance, and sometimes a third chance, in all fairness.\'a0 And it\'92s something that everybody in this room should be very proud about, because you\'92ve always felt that way long before it was fashionable.\'a0 So I want to thank you for that.\'a0 (Applause.)\
As we revive our economy, we are also renewing our national spirit.\'a0 Today we proudly proclaim that faith is alive and well and thriving in America.\'a0 And we\'92re going to keep it that way.\'a0 Nobody will have it changed.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0\'a0 It won\'92t happen.\'a0 As long as I\'92m here, it will never, ever happen.\'a0 (Applause.)\
Something which wasn\'92t done nearly enough \'97 I could almost say wasn\'92t done at all \'97 we are standing up for persecuted Christians and religious minorities all around the world \'97 (applause) \'97 like nobody has ever done.\
Last year, at the United Nations, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting of religious freedom.\'a0 It was based all on religious freedom.\'a0 That was the first meeting of its kind ever held at the United Nations.\'a0 There I called upon all nations to combat the terrible injustice of religious persecution.\'a0 And people listened.\
And countries that we give billions of dollars to, they listened because they had to listen.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 It\'92s amazing how that works, isn\'92t it?\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 That nobody ever played that game before.\'a0 (Laughter.)\
Weeks ago, a 21-year-old woman, who goes by the name of Mary, was seized and imprisoned in Iran because she converted to Christianity and shared the Gospel with others.\
In Venezuela, the dictator Maduro has arrested church leaders.\'a0 At the State of the Union, I was honored to host the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\'f3.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Good man.\'a0 I told him that all Americans stand with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.\
Yesterday, our administration launched the International Religious Freedom Alliance, the first-ever alliance devoted to promoting religious liberty.\'a0 It was something.\'a0 Really something.\'a0 (Applause.)\
More than 25 countries have already joined our campaign.\'a0 I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Ambassador Sam Brownback, who are both here this morning, for leading this historic initiative.\'a0 Thank you very much.\'a0 Thank you, Mike.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Thank you.\
All of us here today reaffirm these timeless truths: Faith keeps us free.\'a0 Prayer makes us strong.\'a0 And God alone is the author of life and the giver of grace.\'a0 (Applause.)\
With us this morning is a pastor who embodies the miracle of faith and the power of prayer: Reverend Gerald Toussaint from Louisiana.\'a0 Reverend Toussaint is an Army veteran, a truck driver, and a pastor.\'a0 He leads the same church that his father led, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, which has been a pillar of the community for more than 140 years.\
Last year, Mount Pleasant was one of three African American churches in Louisiana that was destroyed in a fire set by a wicked, hate-filled arsonist.\
Yet, in the wake of such shocking evil, America witnessed the unshakable unity, devotion, and spirit of Reverend Toussaint and his entire highly spirited, beautiful congregation.\'a0 Families quickly came together in prayer.\'a0 Soon, people from all across Louisiana came to help any way they could.\'a0 Americans in all 50 states and 20 different countries heard about it and they donated more than $2 million to help rebuild Mount Pleasant \'97 (applause) \'97 and the other two churches that were (inaudible).\
On Easter Sunday, just days after he lost his church, Reverend Toussaint preached about what it all meant.\'a0 What does it mean?\'a0 \'93The Easter season,\'94 he said, \'93is a fitting metaphor for recent events.\'a0 It was dark the day that Jesus was crucified.\'a0 It was dark [at] night when they burned our church.\'a0 What has happened since is like a resurrection.\'94\'a0 Old things are gone, but it\'92s going to be a brand-new start, and it\'92s going to be better than ever, Reverend.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Better than ever. \'a0Fantastic.\
And today, just 10 months later, the ground is cleared.\'a0 Careful plans have been made, and they\'92re beautiful plans.\'a0 And construction is about to begin on the new and very, very magnificent Mount Pleasant Church.\'a0 Congratulations.\'a0 (Applause.)\
You know, the Reverend says that we\'92re rebuilding because that\'92s what Jesus does.\'a0 He rebuilds, he lives, and he breathes.\'a0 It\'92s what he does.\'a0 He wants it to be rebuilt.\'a0 It was torn apart, but it\'92s being rebuilt again, and I\'92ll bet you it will indeed be bigger, better, and nicer than before.\'a0 What do you think, Reverend?\'a0 Yes?\'a0 And it\'92s going to have your mark on it.\'a0 It did have and now it will have even great.\'a0 And your father is looking down on you right now and he\'92s very, very proud of the job that you\'92ve done.\'a0 Thank you very much.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Very much inspire us, Reverend.\'a0 Thank you.\
Well, I want to just thank everybody.\'a0 This has been very special.\'a0 Tell your congregation that \'97 and all of your people \'97 that we have 350 million people in our country.\'a0 They\'92re proud Americans.\'a0 And they respect what we\'92re doing, even those that you don\'92t think so much like us, respect us, want to be with us.\'a0 They\'92re respecting our fight, and we are in a fight.\
Religion in this country and religion all over the world \'97 certain religions in particular \'97 are under siege.\'a0 We won\'92t let that happen.\'a0 We are going to protect our religions.\'a0 We are going to protect Christianity.\'a0 We are going to protect our great ministers and pastors and rabbis and all of the people that we so cherish and that we so respect.\
America is eternally in the debt of our nation\'92s African American churches all throughout this country.\'a0 That\'92s why it\'92s so fitting and so \'97 it\'92s one of the reasons we chose this particular church in Louisiana.\'a0 For generations, they bravely fought for justice and lifted up the conscience of our nation.\'a0 And we\'92re grateful beyond any measure.\
But I can say that going beyond that, we\'92re grateful to the people in this room for the love they show to religion.\'a0 Not one religion, but many religions.\'a0 They are brave.\'a0 They are brilliant.\'a0 They are fighters.\'a0 They like people.\'a0 And sometimes they hate people.\'a0 I\'92m sorry.\'a0 I apologize.\'a0 I\'92m trying to learn.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 It\'92s not easy.\'a0 It\'92s not easy.\'a0 (Applause.)\
When they impeach you for nothing, then you\'92re supposed to like them?\'a0 It\'92s not easy, folks.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 I do my best.\
But I\'92ll tell you what we are doing: We\'92re restoring hope and spreading faith.\'a0 We\'92re helping citizens of every background take part in the great rebuilding of our nation.\'a0 We\'92re declaring that America will always shine as a land of liberty and light unto all nations of the world.\'a0 We want every nation to look up to us like they are right now.\'a0 We were not a respected nation just a few years ago.\'a0 We had lost our way.\'a0 Our country is respected again by everybody.\'a0 (Applause.)\
This morning, let us ask Father in Heaven to guide our steps, protect our children, and bless our families.\'a0 And with all of our heart, let us forever embrace the eternal truth that every child is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.\
Thank you.\'a0 God Bless you.\'a0 And God bless America.\'a0 Thank you all very much.\'a0 Thank you.\'a0 Thank you. \
Thank you. Thank you very much. Please, thank you.\
It was a big day yesterday. An incredible day. And last night, the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate Majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the midtown and midterm year. We did this in spite of a very dramatic fundraising disadvantage driven by Democrats\'92 wealthy donors and special interests, and very hostile media coverage, to put it mildly. The media coverage set a new record and a new standard.\
We also had a staggering number of House retirements. So it\'92s a little tough. These are seats that could\'92ve been held pretty easily, and we had newcomers going in, and a lot of them worked very hard. But it\'92s very difficult when you have that many retirements.\
We held a large number of campaign rallies with large, large numbers of people going to every one \'97 and to the best of my knowledge, we didn\'92t have a vacant or an empty seat; I\'92m sure you would have reported it if you spotted one \'97 including 30 rallies in the last 60 days. And we saw the candidates that I supported achieve great success last night.\
As an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, 9 won last night. This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about. I don\'92t know if there ever was such a thing, but could\'92ve been. If we didn\'92t do the campaign, probably there could\'92ve been. And the history really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks in terms of getting some tremendous people over the finish line. They really are tremendous people, but many of them were not known. But they will be known.\
This election marks the largest Senate gains for a President\'92s party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy\'92s in 1962.\
There have been only four midterm elections since 1934 in which a President\'92s party has gained even a single Senate seat. As of now, we picked up, it looks like, three. Could be four. Perhaps it could be two. But we picked up a lot. And most likely, that number will be three. You people probably know that better than I do at this point, because you\'92ve looked at the more recent numbers.\
Fifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years. In the last 80 years, a sitting President\'92s party has only gained a cumulative total of eight Senate seats, averaging one per decade. So, if we picked up two, three, or four, that\'92s a big percentage of that number. So in the last 80 years \'97 you think of that \'97 only eight seats.\
In President Obama\'92s first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep-blue state of Massachusetts.\
Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents. And these are tremendously talented, hardworking people that did this \'97 Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri. We also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee \'97 I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha \'97 and in Utah. And Arizona is looking very good. Really, very good. She\'92s done a terrific job. That was a tough race, and she\'92s done a fantastic job.\
In each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising and media support. We were getting bombarded with money on the other side.\
In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements \'97 the most House Republican retirements in 88 years; 43 House Republicans retired.\
Now, I will say this \'97 that, in many cases, they were chairman of committees, and they left because they weren\'92t chairman, because the Republicans have a rule \'97 for six years. And what that does is wonderful in one way; it lets people come through the system and become chairman. And, in another way, it drives people out. Because when they\'92re a chairman, they don\'92t want to go and not be a chairman. You\'92re the chairman of a committee, and you\'92re a big deal, and then all of a sudden you\'92re not doing that anymore. So they leave. We had a lot of them leave. I guess you can flip a coin as to which system is better. The Democrats do the other. Some of their folks have been in these committees for a long time as chairman.\
In 2010, President Obama\'92s first midterm, he lost 63 seats. By contrast, as of the most current count, it looks like around 27 House seats or something. And we\'92ll figure that out pretty soon.\
We also had a slew of historic wins in the governors\'92 races \'97 the governors\'92 races were incredible \'97 against very well-funded, talented, and skilled Democrat candidates and people that worked very, very hard, respectfully, for those candidates, like Oprah Winfrey, who I like. I don\'92t know if she likes me anymore, but that\'92s okay. She used to. But she worked very hard in Georgia. Very, very hard.\
And if you look at them, we won four governors\'92 races crucial to 2020 and the presidential race: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. The big ones: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. Can\'92t get much more important than that. They were incredible. They were actually incredible campaigns, too. Incredible.\
As of right now, Republicans will control the majority of governorships across the country, including three great women who worked very hard: the governors of Alabama, South Dakota, and Iowa. They worked very, very hard. They\'92re very talented.\
By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings. That was a factor. I think maybe a very big factor. The way that was handled, I think, was \'97 tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh. And expressed their support for confirming more great pro-Constitution judges.\
Candidates who embraced our message of low taxes, low regulations, low crime, strong borders, and great judges excelled last night. They excelled. They really \'97 I mean, we have a list of people that were fantastic, and I\'92m just going to point them out: Mike Bost; Rodney Davis; Andy Barr was fantastic. I went to Kentucky \'97 for the most part, I didn\'92t campaign for the House, but I did actually make a special trip for Andy Barr because he was in a very tough race in Kentucky, and he won. That was a very tough race. The polls were all showing that he was down, and down substantially. And he won. And that one, I did do.\
Pete Stauber, of Minnesota. Great guy. He\'92s new and ran a fantastic race.\
On the other hand, you had some that decided to \'93let\'92s stay away.\'94 \'93Let\'92s stay away.\'94 They did very poorly. I\'92m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it.\
Carlos Curbelo; Mike Coffman \'97 too bad, Mike; Mia Love. I saw Mia Love. She\'92d call me all the time to help her with a hostage situation. Being held hostage in Venezuela. But Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\
And Barbara Comstock was another one. I mean, I think she could have run that race, but she didn\'92t want to have any embrace. For that, I don\'92t blame her. But she \'97 she lost. Substantially lost.\
Peter Roskam didn\'92t want the embrace. Erik Paulsen didn\'92t want the embrace. And in New Jersey, I think he could have done well, but didn\'92t work out too good.\
Bob Hugin, I feel badly because I think that\'92s something that could have been won. That\'92s a race that could have been won. That\'92s a race that could have been won. John Faso.\
Those are some of the people that, you know, decided for their own reason not to embrace, whether it\'92s me or what we stand for. But what we stand for meant a lot to most people. And we\'92ve had tremendous support, and tremendous support in the Republican Party. Among the biggest support in the history of the party. I\'92ve actually heard, at 93 percent, it\'92s a record. But I won\'92t say that, because who knows. But we\'92ve had tremendous support.\
America is booming like never before. Doing fantastic. We have Larry Kudlow here, and he said the numbers are as good as he\'92s ever seen \'97 numbers \'97 at any time for our country. But he\'92s a young man, so he hasn\'92t seen that many numbers. (Laughter.) Where\'92s Larry? You\'92re a young man. Right, Larry? And you haven\'92t been doing this too long, but they\'92re as good as you\'92ve ever seen. And we may have \'97 if you have a question for Larry, we\'92ll do that.\
But I want to send my warmest appreciation in regards to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We really worked very well together. We have been working very well together. We actually have a great relationship. People just don\'92t understand that, which is fine.\
And also to, perhaps \'97 it looks like, I would think \'97 Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard, and she\'92s worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she\'92s done and what she\'92s accomplished.\
Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. These are some of things that the Democrats do want to work on, and I really believe we\'92ll be able to do that. I think we\'92re going to have a lot of reason to do it.\
And I will say, just as a matter of business, I was with some very successful people last night. We were watching the returns. So if the Republicans won \'97 and let\'92s say we held on by two, or one, or three \'97 it would\'92ve been very hard out of that many Republicans to ever even get support among Republicans, because there will always be one, or two, or three people that, for a good reason or for a bad reason, or for grandstanding \'97 we have that too; you\'92ve seen that. You\'92ve seen that. Plenty of grandstanding. But for certain reasons that many people \'97 you\'92re always going to have a couple that won\'92t do it. So that puts us in a very bad position.\
In other words, had we kept it, and this is no \'97 I\'92m saying this for very basic reasons, common sense \'97 it puts us in a very tough position. We win by one, or two, or three, and you\'92ll have one, or two, or three, or four or five even, come over and say, you know, \'93Look, we\'92re not going to along with this. We want this, this, this\'85\'94 And all of a sudden, we can\'92t even \'97 we wouldn\'92t even be able to get, in many cases, out of the Republicans\'92 hands before we sent it on to the Senate.\
And now we have a much easier path, because the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for healthcare, a plan for whatever they are looking at, and we\'92ll negotiate. And as you know, it\'92s been very hard in the Senate because we need, essentially, 10 votes from Democrats, and we don\'92t get those votes. Because the Democrats do really stick together well. I don\'92t agree with them on a lot of policy, but I agree with them on sticking together. They stick together great.\
So now we go into the Senate. We don\'92t have the 10 votes. And what happens? It doesn\'92t get passed. Even if it gets out of the House, it doesn\'92t get passed. So under the new concept of what we\'92re doing, I say, \'93Come on. Let me see what you have.\'94 They want to do things. You know, I keep hearing about investigations fatigue. Like from the time \'97 almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they\'92ve been giving us this investigation fatigue. It\'92s been a long time. They got nothing. Zero. You know why? Because there is nothing.\
But they can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate. And a lot of very questionable things were done between leaks of classified information, and many other elements that should not have taken place. And all you\'92re going to do is end up in back and forth, and back and forth. And two years is going to go up, and we won\'92t have done a thing.\
I really think, and I really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting. She used the word \'93uniting\'94 and she used the word the bipartisanship statement, which is so important because that\'92s what we should be doing. So we can look at us, they can look at us, and we can look at them, and it\'92ll go back and forth. And it\'92ll probably be very good for me politically. I could see it being extremely good politically, because I think I\'92m better at that game than they are, actually.\
But we\'92ll find out. I mean, you know, we\'92ll find out. Or we can work together. You can\'92t do them simultaneously, by the way. Just think if somebody said, \'93Oh, you can do them both.\'94 No, you can\'92t. Because if they\'92re doing that, we\'92re not doing the other, just so you understand. So we won\'92t be doing that.\
But now what happens is we send it to the Senate, and we\'92ll get 100 percent Democrat support, and we\'92ll get some Republican support. And if it\'92s good, I really believe we have Republicans that will help with the approval process \'97 and they will really help with the approval process.\
So it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. If we won by one or two or three, or four or five, that wouldn\'92t happen. And the closer it is, the worse it is. This way, they\'92ll come to me, we\'92ll negotiate. Maybe we\'92ll make a deal, maybe we won\'92t. That\'92s possible. But we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.\
We want to do something on healthcare; they want to do something on healthcare. There are a lot of great things that we can do together. And now we\'92ll send it up and we will really get \'97 we\'92ll get the Democrats and we\'92ll get the Republicans, or some of the Republicans. And I\'92ll make sure that we send something up that the Republicans can support, and they\'92re going to want to make sure they send something up that the Democrats can support.\
So our great country is booming like never before, and we\'92re thriving on every single level, both in terms of economic and military strength; in terms of development. In terms of GDP, we\'92re doing unbelievably.\
I will tell you, our trade deals are coming along fantastically. The USMCA and South Korea is finished. USMCA has gotten rave reviews. Not going to lose companies anymore to other countries. They\'92re not going to do that because they have a tremendous economic incentive, meaning it\'92s prohibitive for them to do that.\
So it\'92s not going to be like NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals I\'92ve ever seen \'97 although we\'92ve made some other pretty bad ones too.\
Now is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the American economic miracle going strong. It is a miracle. We\'92re doing so well. And I\'92ve said it at a lot of rallies. Some of you have probably heard it so much you don\'92t want to hear it again. But when people come to my office \'97 presidents, prime ministers \'97 they all congratulate me, almost the first thing, on what we\'92ve done economically. Because it is really amazing.\
And our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.\
We must all work together to protect our military \'97 I have to do that \'97 to support out law enforcement, secure our borders, and advance really great policy, including environmental policy. We want crystal-clean water. We want beautiful, perfect air. Air and water, it has to be perfect.\
At the same time, we don\'92t want to put ourselves at a disadvantage to other countries who are very competitive with us and who don\'92t abide by the rules at all. We don\'92t want to hurt our jobs. We don\'92t want to hurt our factories. We don\'92t want companies leaving. We want to be totally competitive, and we are.\
And right now we have just about the cleanest air, the cleanest water we\'92ve ever had, and it\'92s always going to be that way. We insist on it. So environmental is very important to me.\

\fs36 \cf3 \cb4 I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.\cb1 \
\cb4 I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.\cb1 \
\cb4 It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.\cb1 \
\cb4 As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.\cb1 \
\cb4 It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people -- and serve the people it will.\cb1 \
\cb4 Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.\cb1 \
\cb4 That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.\cb1 \
\cb4 The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\cb1 \
\cb4 We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\cb1 \
\cb4 We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people.\cb1 \
\cb4 We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen.\cb1 \
\cb4 We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships.\cb1 \
\cb4 No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.\cb1 \
\cb4 America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.\cb1 \
\cb4 I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations.\cb1 \
\cb4 We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.\cb1 \
\cb4 And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.\cb1 \
\cb4 First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. Truly great parents.\cb1 \
\cb4 I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually.\cb1 \
\cb4 And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?\cb1 \
\cb4 My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great.\cb1 \
\cb4 And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.\cb1 \
\cb4 Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.\cb1 \
\cb4 To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.\cb1 \
\cb4 This was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it is tough.\cb1 \
\cb4 So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.\cb1 \
\cb4 You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.\cb1 \
\cb4 And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.\cb1 \
\cb4 I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?\cb1 \
\cb4 Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get.\cb1 \
\cb4 Sen. Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?\cb1 \
\cb4 Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and they are special people.\cb1 \
\cb4 We have 22 Congressional Medal of Honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is ... that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like Secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.\cb1 \
\cb4 Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy, and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.\cb1 \
\cb4 Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.\cb1 \
\cb4 Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.\cb1 \
\cb4 The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.\cb1 \
\cb4 And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately. We appreciate them.\cb1 \
\cb4 So it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job, and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you. You will say that -- you will say that that was something that you were -- really were very proud to do and I can \'97 thank you very much.\cb1 \
\cb4 And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your President. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.\cb1 \

\f1 \cf5 \cb6 Today's the day that I've been looking very much forward to all year long. It's one that we have heard and we speak about and we dream about and now as the President of the United States, it's my tremendous honor to finally wish America and the world a very Merry Christmas.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 I want to thank everyone who has come together here right in front of the White House, that beautiful, beautiful White House, and everyone watching from home to see the lighting of this incredible national Christmas tree.\cb1 \
\cb6 For nearly a century, through good times and bad, every president has taken part in this wonderful tradition, first started by President Coolidge. But I was informed tonight that the weather we have is the best it's been in 25 years. In fact, I said, \'91Is it always like this?\'92 And the secretary said, \'91Hasn't been like this for a long time.\'92 So, we are very lucky.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, in 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed legislation making Christmas a Federal holiday. And I sort of feel we are doing that again. That\'92s what's happening.\'a0\
From the earliest days of our nations, Americans have known Christmas as a time for prayer and worship, for gratitude and good will, for peace and renewal.\'a0\
Melania and I are full of joy at the start of this very blessed season. We're thrilled to think of the people across the nation and all across the continent whose spirits are lifted by the miracle of Christmas.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 For Christians, this is a Holy season \'96 the celebration of the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Christmas story begins 2000 years ago with a mother, a father, their baby son, and the most extraordinary gift of all, the gift of God's love for all of humanity.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 Whatever our beliefs, we know that the birth of Jesus Christ and the story of this incredible life forever changed the course of human history. There\'92s hardly an aspect of our lives today that his life has not touched: art, music, culture, law, and our respect for the sacred dignity of every person everywhere in the world.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 Each and every year at Christmas time we recognize that the real spirit of Christmas is not what we have, it's about who we are \'96 each one of us is a child of God.\cb1 \
\cb6 That is the true source of joy this time of the year.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 That is what makes every Christmas \'91merry.\'92\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 And that is what we remember at today's beautiful ceremony, that we are called to serve one another, to love one another, and to pursue peace in our hearts and all throughout the world.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 And so tonight, I thank the millions of Americans who light our lives and brighten our wonderful communities. I thank those who are serving the needy during the season and throughout the year. I thank our military men and women who are stationed around the world keeping us safe.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 I thank our law enforcement officers who protect our streets and secure our homeland. I thank America's teachers, pastors, and all those religious, and those people that have taught us so much, for their leadership in our communities and our society.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 And, especially tonight, I thank America's families. At Christmas, we are reminded more than ever that the family is the bedrock of American life.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 And so, this Christmas we ask for God\'92s blessings for our family, for our nation. And we pray that our country will be a place where every child knows a home filled with love, a community rich with hope, and a nation blest with faith.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 On behalf of Melania, myself, Barron, all of my children, all of my grandchildren \'97 they're here with us tonight \'97 I want to thank you.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. Happy new year. Thank you.\

\cf0 Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day customs and border patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation. But, all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.\cb1 \
\cb6 In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.\cb1 \
\cb6 Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.\
My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem. Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe. In fact, safer than ever before. The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home. Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.\cb1 \
\cb6 This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico. Sen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president. Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation. But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government. This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.\cb1 \
\cb6 Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is for the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized. America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\
Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl. Over the last several years, I have met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\cb1 \
\cb6 For those who refuse to compromise in the name of in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do so help me God. Thank you and good night.\

\f0\fs40 \cf7 Last night, the United States brought the world\'92s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.\'a0 He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization in the World.\'a0 The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years.\'a0 Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my Administration.\'a0 U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid into Northwestern Syria to accomplish this mission.\cb1 \
\cb6 No U.S. personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi\'92s fighters and companions were killed with him.\'a0 He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming.\'a0 The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed.\'a0 Eleven young children were moved out of the house un-injured.\'a0 The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, who had dragged three children with him to certain death.\'a0 He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\'a0 His body was mutilated by the blast, but test results gave certain and positive identification.\cb1 \
\cb6 The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, panic and dread \'96 terrified of the American Forces bearing down.\cb1 \
\cb6 We were in the compound for approximately 2 hours, and after the mission was accomplished we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid.\cb1 \
\cb6 Baghdadi\'92s demise demonstrates America\'92s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders, and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS!\cb1 \
\cb6 The reach of America is long.\'a0 As you know, last month we announced that we recently killed Hamza Bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama Bin Laden, who was saying very bad things.\cb1 \
\cb6 He was the heir apparent to Al Qaeda. Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them. These savage monsters will not escape their fate \'96 and they will not escape the final judgement of God.\cb1 \
\cb6 Baghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office. At my direction, as Commander-in-Chief, the United States obliterated his \'91caliphate\'92 in March of this year.\'a0 Today\'92s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end.\cb1 \
\cb6 Baghdadi and the losers who worked with him \'96 in some cases people who had no idea what they were getting into and how dangerous and unglamorous it was \'96 killed many people.\'a0 Their murder of innocent Americans Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller were especially heinous.\'a0 The shocking publicized murder of a Jordanian pilot who was burned alive in a cage for all to see, and the execution of Christians in Libya and Egypt, as well as the genocidal mass murder of Yazidis, rank ISIS among the most depraved organizations in history.\cb1 \
\cb6 The forced religious conversions, the orange suits prior to many beheadings, all of which were openly displayed for the world \'96 this was all Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\'92s work.\'a0 He was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying.\'a0 This raid was impeccable, and could only have taken place with the acknowledgement and help of certain other nations and people.\cb1 \
\cb6 I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible.\cb1 \
\cb6 I want to thank the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines involved in last night\'92s operation.\'a0 You are the very best there is anywhere in the world.\'a0 I want to thank General Mark Milley and our Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the mission\'92s success.\cb1 \
\cb6 Last night was a great night for the United States and for the World. A brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, was violently eliminated \'96 he will never again harm another innocent man, woman or child.\'a0 He died like a dog.\'a0 He died like a coward.\'a0 The world is now a much safer place.\cb1 \
\cb6 God bless the United States of America!\
My fellow Americans, today I speak to a nation in grief. Yesterday, a school filled with innocent children and caring teachers became the scene of terrible violence, hatred, and evil.\cb1 \
\cb6 Around 2:30 yesterday afternoon, police responded to reports of gunfire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida\'97a great and safe community. There, a shooter, who is now in custody, opened fire on defenseless students and teachers. He murdered 17 people and badly wounded at least 14 others.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families. To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you\'97whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain. We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also.\cb1 \
\cb6 No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning.\cb1 \
\cb6 Each person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them\'97a life filled with wondrous beauty and unlimited potential and promise. Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give, and talents to share with the world. And each one had a family to whom they meant everything in the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 Today, we mourn for all of those who lost their lives. We comfort the grieving and the wounded. And we hurt for the entire community of Parkland, Florida that is now in shock, in pain, and searching for answers.\cb1 \
\cb6 To law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We thank you for your courage. Soon after the shooting, I spoke with Governor Scott to convey our deepest sympathies to the people of Florida and our determination to assist in any way that we can. I also spoke with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\cb1 \
\cb6 I\'92m making plans to visit Parkland to meet with families and local officials, and to continue coordinating the federal response.\cb1 \
\cb6 In these moments of heartache and darkness, we hold on to God\'92s word in scripture: \'93I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you.\'94\cb1 \
\cb6 We trust in that promise, and we hold fast to our fellow Americans in their time of sorrow.\cb1 \
\cb6 I want to speak now directly to America\'92s children, especially those who feel lost, alone, confused or even scared: I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you. If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer, or a faith leader. Answer hate with love; answer cruelty with kindness.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our administration is working closely with local authorities to investigate the shooting and learn everything we can. We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.\cb1 \
\cb6 Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation\'92s governors and attorney generals, where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference.\cb1 \
\cb6 In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil, and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.\cb1 \
\cb6 And so always, but especially today, let us hold our loved ones close, let us pray for healing and for peace, and let us come together as one nation to wipe away the tears and strive for a much better tomorrow.\cb1 \
\cb6 Thank you. And God Bless you all. Thank you very much.\
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\cb1 \
\cb6 Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People\'97and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\cb1 \
\cb6 Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission\'97to make America great again for all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb6 Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\'92s soul, and the steel in America\'92s spine.\cb1 \
\cb6 Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\cb1 \
\cb6 We saw the volunteers of the \'93Cajun Navy,\'94 racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.\cb1 \
\cb6 We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\cb1 \
\cb6 We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee.\cb1 \
\cb6 We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.\cb1 \
\cb6 To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else\'97we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.\cb1 \
\cb6 Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House\'97a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.\cb1 \
\cb6 In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.\cb1 \
\cb6 Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\cb1 \
\cb6 So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.\cb1 \
\cb6 And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\cb1 \
\cb6 Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\cb1 \
\cb6 Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\cb1 \
\cb6 Small business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans\'92 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.\cb1 \
\cb6 And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.\cb1 \
\cb6 To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\cb1 \
\cb6 A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000k\'97slashing their tax bill in half.\cb1 \
\cb6 This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system\'97and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.\cb1 \
\cb6 We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year\'97forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare\'97the individual mandate is now gone.\cb1 \
\cb6 We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.\cb1 \
\cb6 Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing\'97a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\cb1 \
\cb6 One of Staub\'92s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax\uc0\u8209 cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\'92 education. Please join me in congratulating Corey.\cb1 \
\cb6 Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses\'97many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\cb1 \
\cb6 This is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\cb1 \
\cb6 So to every citizen watching at home tonight\'97no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.\cb1 \
\cb6 We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.\cb1 \
\cb6 Together, we are rediscovering the American way.\cb1 \
\cb6 In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is \'93in God we trust.\'94\cb1 \
\cb6 And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\'92 graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done.\cb1 \
\cb6 Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston\'92s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\cb1 \
\cb6 Americans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.\cb1 \
\cb6 For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.\cb1 \
\cb6 Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.\cb1 \
\cb6 And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve\'97and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.\cb1 \
\cb6 I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\cb1 \
\cb6 All Americans deserve accountability and respect\'97and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers\'97and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\cb1 \
\cb6 In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have ended the war on American Energy\'97and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America\'92s autoworkers\'97so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.\cb1 \
\cb6 Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States\'97something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing\'97for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back.\cb1 \
\cb6 Exciting progress is happening every day.\cb1 \
\cb6 To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.\cb1 \
\cb6 We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.\cb1 \
\cb6 People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure\'97I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the \'93right to try.\'94\cb1 \
\cb6 One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I\'a0have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.\cb1 \
\cb6 America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation\'92s wealth.\cb1 \
\cb6 The era of economic surrender is over.\cb1 \
\cb6 From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.\cb1 \
\cb6 And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\cb1 \
\cb6 As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\cb1 \
\cb6 America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year\'97is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\cb1 \
\cb6 I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.\cb1 \
\cb6 Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment\'97to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.\cb1 \
\cb6 Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process\'97getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.\cb1 \
\cb6 Together, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\cb1 \
\cb6 We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\'92s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.\cb1 \
\cb6 We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\cb1 \
\cb6 As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.\cb1 \
\cb6 As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\cb1 \
\cb6 Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\cb1 \
\cb6 For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.\'a0 Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters\'97Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens\'97were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\'92s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\'92s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors\'97and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\'92s high school.\cb1 \
\cb6 Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:\'a0 Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.\cb1 \
\cb6 The United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America\'92s children, America\'92s struggling workers, and America\'92s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\cb1 \
\cb6 So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties\'97Democrats and Republicans\'97to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans\'97to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez\'97he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ\'92s murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.\cb1 \
\cb6 CJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.\cb1 \
\cb6 Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.\cb1 \
\cb6 In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise\'97one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here are the four pillars of our plan:\cb1 \
\cb6 The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age\'97that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.\cb1 \
\cb6 The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country\'97and it finally ends the dangerous practice of \'93catch and release.\'94\cb1 \
\cb6 The third pillar ends the visa lottery\'97a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system\'97one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\cb1 \
\cb6 The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\cb1 \
\cb6 In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.\cb1 \
\cb6 It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\cb1 \
\cb6 These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\cb1 \
\cb6 For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\cb1 \
\cb6 Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\cb1 \
\cb6 These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.\cb1 \
\cb6 In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\cb1 \
\cb6 My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult\'97but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\cb1 \
\cb6 As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.\cb1 \
\cb6 We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\cb1 \
\cb6 In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \'93You will do it\'97because you can.\'94 He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\cb1 \
\cb6 Ryan and Rebecca: You embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and congratulations.\cb1 \
\cb6 As we rebuild America\'92s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\cb1 \
\cb6 Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.\cb1 \
\cb6 For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.\cb1 \
\cb6 As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.\cb1 \
\cb6 Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\cb1 \
\cb6 Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.\cb1 \
\cb6 Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.\cb1 \
\cb6 Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin\'92s selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \'93V\'94 for \'93Valor.\'94 Staff Sergeant Peck:\'a0 All of America salutes you.\cb1 \
\cb6 Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.\cb1 \
\cb6 In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield\'97including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\cb1 \
\cb6 So today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\'e1namo Bay.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa\'92ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists\'97wherever we chase them down.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.\cb1 \
\cb6 Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\cb1 \
\cb6 Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\'92s sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.\cb1 \
\cb6 That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America\'92s friends.\cb1 \
\cb6 As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\cb1 \
\cb6 When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\cb1 \
\cb6 My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\cb1 \
\cb6 But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.\cb1 \
\cb6 North Korea\'92s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.\cb1 \
\cb6 Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.\cb1 \
\cb6 We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.\cb1 \
\cb6 Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June\'97horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\cb1 \
\cb6 Otto\'92s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight\'97along with Otto\'92s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto\'92s memory with American resolve.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\cb1 \
\cb6 In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves\'97permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had\'97and he resolved to be free.\cb1 \
\cb6 Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.\cb1 \
\cb6 Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most\'97the truth.\cb1 \
\cb6 Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\cb1 \
\cb6 Seong-ho\'92s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\cb1 \
\cb6 It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 That is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\cb1 \
\cb6 Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.\cb1 \
\cb6 Monuments to Washington and Jefferson\'97to Lincoln and King.\cb1 \
\cb6 Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga\'97to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.\cb1 \
\cb6 And freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people.\cb1 \
\cb6 A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us\'97defending hope, pride, and the American way.\cb1 \
\cb6 They work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.\cb1 \
\cb6 But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\cb1 \
\cb6 Americans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again.\cb1 \
\cb6 As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\cb1 \
\cb6 As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our families will thrive.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our people will prosper.\cb1 \
\cb6 And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\cb1 \
\cb6 Thank you, and God bless America.\
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. \'a0Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a\'a0Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\cb1 \
\cb6 Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice \'96- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\cb1 \
\cb6 That torch is now in our hands. \'a0And we will use it to light up the world. \'a0I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my\'a0heart.\cb1 \
\cb6 A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.\cb1 \
\cb6 A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.\cb1 \
\cb6 And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\cb1 \
\cb6 What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our allies will find that America is once again ready to\'a0lead.\cb1 \
\cb6 All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\cb1 \
\cb6 In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.\cb1 \
\cb6 It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\cb1 \
\cb6 I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\cb1 \
\cb6 For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\cb1 \
\cb6 We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land.\cb1 \
\cb6 We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\cb1 \
\cb6 And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\cb1 \
\cb6 Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. \'a0The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -\'96 families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\cb1 \
\cb6 But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, the chorus became an earthquake \'96 and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\cb1 \
\cb6 Dying industries will come roaring back to life. \'a0Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\cb1 \
\cb6 Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\cb1 \
\cb6 And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\cb1 \
\cb6 Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\cb1 \
\cb6 It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.\cb1 \
\cb6 Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have\'a0announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the\'a0United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\cb1 \
\cb6 The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. \'a0We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. \'a0We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials \'96- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have undertaken a historic effort to eliminate job\uc0\u8209 crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of\'a0thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\cb1 \
\cb6 With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\cb1 \
\cb6 To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\cb1 \
\cb6 I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\cb1 \
\cb6 At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.\'a0 By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.\'a0 We want all Americans to succeed \'96- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.\'a0 We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\cb1 \
\cb6 For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border.\cb1 \
\cb6 As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and\'a0criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. \'a0Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I\'a0have promised.\cb1 \
\cb6 To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: \'a0what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\cb1 \
\cb6 Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. \'a0We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\cb1 \
\cb6 According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. \'a0We have seen the attacks at home -\'96 from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.\'a0 Those given the high honor of admission to the United\'a0States should support this country and love its people\'a0and its values.\cb1 \
\cb6 We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\cb1 \
\cb6 That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.\cb1 \
\cb6 As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.\'a0 We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\cb1 \
\cb6 I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution.\'a0 I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.\'a0 Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.\'a0 To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.\'a0 He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\cb1 \
\cb6 Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\cb1 \
\cb6 Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\cb1 \
\cb6 More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\cb1 \
\cb6 We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\cb1 \
\cb6 In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\cb1 \
\cb6 We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\cb1 \
\cb6 And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\cb1 \
\cb6 Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. \'a0It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\cb1 \
\cb6 But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\cb1 \
\cb6 Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\cb1 \
\cb6 My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.\'a0 At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\cb1 \
\cb6 Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\cb1 \
\cb6 I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.\'a0 In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\cb1 \
\cb6 At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? \'a0They said that it's good.\'a0 I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.\'a0 They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.\'a0 They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\cb1 \
\cb6 They weren't even asking for change.\'a0 But I am.\cb1 \
\cb6 I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\cb1 \
\cb6 The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the "abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people."\cb1 \
\cb6 Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I\'a0am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am going to bring back millions of jobs. \'a0Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.\'a0 The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\cb1 \
\cb6 Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others \'96- have a merit-based immigration system.\'a0 It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.\'a0 Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.\'a0 According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\cb1 \
\cb6 Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: \'a0it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families \'96- including immigrant families \'96- enter the middle class.\cb1 \
\cb6 Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program \'96- the building of the interstate highway system.\'a0 The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\cb1 \
\cb6 America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the\'a0Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.\'a0 With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country \'96- twice.\'a0 And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\cb1 \
\cb6 To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital \'96- creating millions of new jobs.\cb1 \
\cb6 This effort will be guided by two core principles: \'a0Buy American, and Hire American.\cb1 \
\cb6 Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\cb1 \
\cb6 Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.\'a0 The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\cb1 \
\cb6 Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. \'a0As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. \'a0Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.\cb1 \
\cb6 One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges \'96- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\cb1 \
\cb6 Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\cb1 \
\cb6 We now know that all of those promises have been broken.\cb1 \
\cb6 Obamacare is collapsing \'96- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.\'a0 Action is not a choice \'96- it is a necessity.\cb1 \
\cb6 So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\cb1 \
\cb6 Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\cb1 \
\cb6 First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\cb1 \
\cb6 Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts \'96- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\cb1 \
\cb6 Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\cb1 \
\cb6 Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance \'96 and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines \'96- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\cb1 \
\cb6 Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.\'a0 Every problem can be solved.\'a0 And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our citizens deserve this, and so much more \'96- so why not join forces to finally get it done? \'a0On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\cb1 \
\cb6 My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\cb1 \
\cb6 True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\cb1 \
\cb6 An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\cb1 \
\cb6 Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. \'a0Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15\'a0months old.\'a0 She was not expected to live past 5.\cb1 \
\cb6 On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. \'a0He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. \'a0Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\cb1 \
\cb6 Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.\cb1 \
\cb6 But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.\cb1 \
\cb6 If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\cb1 \
\cb6 In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\cb1 \
\cb6 But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind \'96- and the souls \'96- of every American child.\cb1 \
\cb6 Education is the civil rights issue of our time.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. \'a0These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\cb1 \
\cb6 Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. \'a0As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. \'a0But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. \'a0Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. \'a0Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\cb1 \
\cb6 We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\cb1 \
\cb6 But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\cb1 \
\cb6 The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\cb1 \
\cb6 In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone \'96- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\cb1 \
\cb6 This is not acceptable in our society.\cb1 \
\cb6 Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\cb1 \
\cb6 But to create this future, we must work with \'96- not against -\'96 the men and women of law enforcement.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must build bridges of cooperation and trust \'96- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\cb1 \
\cb6 Police and sheriffs are members of our community.\'a0 They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters \'96 and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\cb1 \
\cb6 And we must support the victims of crime.\cb1 \
\cb6 I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.\'a0 The office is called VOICE \'96- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.\'a0 We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\cb1 \
\cb6 Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\cb1 \
\cb6 Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\cb1 \
\cb6 Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.\'a0 Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. \'a0But he never got the chance. \'a0His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\cb1 \
\cb6 Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.\'a0 Their husbands \'96- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis \'96- were slain in the line of duty in California.\'a0 They were pillars of their community.\'a0 These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\cb1 \
\cb6 Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.\'a0 Jenna: \'a0I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\cb1 \
\cb6 To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: \'a0I want you to know \'96- we will never stop fighting for justice. \'a0Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and \'96- if they must \'96- to fight and to win.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\cb1 \
\cb6 My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our veterans have delivered for this Nation \'96- and now we must deliver for them.\cb1 \
\cb6 The challenges we face as a Nation are great.\'a0 But our people are even greater.\cb1 \
\cb6 And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William "Ryan" Owens. \'a0Ryan died as he lived: \'a0a warrior, and a hero \'96- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\cb1 \
\cb6 I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I\'a0quote, "Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies." \'a0Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.\'a0 For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.\'a0 Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom \'96- we will never forget him.\cb1 \
\cb6 To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\cb1 \
\cb6 Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. \'a0It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\cb1 \
\cb6 We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\cb1 \
\cb6 But our partners must meet their financial obligations.\cb1 \
\cb6 And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\cb1 \
\cb6 We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific \'96- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\cb1 \
\cb6 Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people \'96- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. \'a0My job is not to represent the world. \'a0My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must learn from the mistakes of the past \'96- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\cb1 \
\cb6 The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\cb1 \
\cb6 America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.\'a0 We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\cb1 \
\cb6 We want peace, wherever peace can be found.\'a0 America is friends today with former enemies.\'a0 Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.\'a0 This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\cb1 \
\cb6 Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\cb1 \
\cb6 On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. \'a0At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\cb1 \
\cb6 Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\cb1 \
\cb6 Remington unveiled the first typewriter. \'a0An early attempt was made at electric light.\cb1 \
\cb6 Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\cb1 \
\cb6 Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year.\cb1 \
\cb6 Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\cb1 \
\cb6 Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\cb1 \
\cb6 American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\cb1 \
\cb6 Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\cb1 \
\cb6 And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\cb1 \
\cb6 When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb6 This is our vision. This is our mission.\cb1 \
\cb6 But we can only get there together.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are one people, with one destiny.\cb1 \
\cb6 We all bleed the same blood.\cb1 \
\cb6 We all salute the same flag.\cb1 \
\cb6 And we are all made by the same God.\cb1 \
\cb6 And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\cb1 \
\cb6 The time for small thinking is over. \'a0The time for trivial fights is behind us.\cb1 \
\cb6 We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\cb1 \
\cb6 The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\cb1 \
\cb6 And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\cb1 \
\cb6 From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears \'96-\cb1 \
\cb6 inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past \'96-\cb1 \
\cb6 and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\cb1 \
\cb6 I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.\'a0 I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.\'a0 And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --\cb1 \
\cb6 Believe in yourselves.\cb1 \
\cb6 Believe in your future.\cb1 \
\cb6 And believe, once more, in America.\cb1 \
\cb6 Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United\'a0States.\
Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.\cb1 \
\cb6 We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.\cb1 \
\cb6 Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\cb1 \
\cb6 Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.\cb1 \
\cb6 Today\'92s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another \'96 but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.\cb1 \
\cb6 For too long, a small group in our nation\'92s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\cb1 \
\cb6 Washington flourished \'96 but the people did not share in its wealth.\cb1 \
\cb6 Politicians prospered \'96 but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\cb1 \
\cb6 The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\cb1 \
\cb6 Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation\'92s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\cb1 \
\cb6 That all changes \'96 starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\cb1 \
\cb6 It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 This is your day. This is your celebration.\cb1 \
\cb6 And this, the United States of America, is your country.\cb1 \
\cb6 What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\cb1 \
\cb6 January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb6 The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\cb1 \
\cb6 Everyone is listening to you now.\cb1 \
\cb6 You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\cb1 \
\cb6 At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.\cb1 \
\cb6 Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\cb1 \
\cb6 These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.\cb1 \
\cb6 But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\cb1 \
\cb6 This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\cb1 \
\cb6 We are one nation \'96 and their pain is our pain.\'a0 Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.\'a0 We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\cb1 \
\cb6 The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb6 For many decades, we\'92ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;\cb1 \
\cb6 Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;\cb1 \
\cb6 We've defended other nation\'92s borders while refusing to defend our own;\cb1 \
\cb6 And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\cb1 \
\cb6 We\'92ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\cb1 \
\cb6 One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\cb1 \
\cb6 The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\cb1 \
\cb6 But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\cb1 \
\cb6 We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\cb1 \
\cb6 From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\cb1 \
\cb6 From this moment on, it\'92s going to be America First.\cb1 \
\cb6 Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\cb1 \
\cb6 We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\'a0 Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\cb1 \
\cb6 I will fight for you with every breath in my body \'96 and I will never, ever let you down.\cb1 \
\cb6 America will start winning again, winning like never before.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.\'a0 We will bring back our wealth.\'a0 And we will bring back our dreams.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will get our people off of welfare and back to work \'96 rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world \'96 but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\cb1 \
\cb6 We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones \'96 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\cb1 \
\cb6 At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\cb1 \
\cb6 When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\cb1 \
\cb6 The Bible tells us, \'93how good and pleasant it is when God\'92s people live together in unity.\'94\cb1 \
\cb6 We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.\cb1 \
\cb6 When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\cb1 \
\cb6 There should be no fear \'96 we are protected, and we will always be protected.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\cb1 \
\cb6 Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.\cb1 \
\cb6 In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action \'96 constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\cb1 \
\cb6 The time for empty talk is over.\cb1 \
\cb6 Now arrives the hour of action.\cb1 \
\cb6 Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.\'a0 No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.\cb1 \
\cb6 We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\cb1 \
\cb6 We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\cb1 \
\cb6 A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\cb1 \
\cb6 It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\cb1 \
\cb6 And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\cb1 \
\cb6 So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\cb1 \
\cb6 You will never be ignored again.\cb1 \
\cb6 Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\cb1 \
\cb6 Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.\cb1 \
\cb6 We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\cb1 \
\cb6 We Will Make America Proud Again.\cb1 \
\cb6 We Will Make America Safe Again.\cb1 \
\cb6 And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.}
