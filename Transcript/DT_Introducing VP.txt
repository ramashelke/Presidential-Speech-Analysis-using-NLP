Thank you. Thank you very much. Please, thank you.\
It was a big day yesterday. An incredible day. And last night, the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate Majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the midtown and midterm year. We did this in spite of a very dramatic fundraising disadvantage driven by Democrats\'92 wealthy donors and special interests, and very hostile media coverage, to put it mildly. The media coverage set a new record and a new standard.\
We also had a staggering number of House retirements. So it\'92s a little tough. These are seats that could\'92ve been held pretty easily, and we had newcomers going in, and a lot of them worked very hard. But it\'92s very difficult when you have that many retirements.\
We held a large number of campaign rallies with large, large numbers of people going to every one \'97 and to the best of my knowledge, we didn\'92t have a vacant or an empty seat; I\'92m sure you would have reported it if you spotted one \'97 including 30 rallies in the last 60 days. And we saw the candidates that I supported achieve great success last night.\
As an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, 9 won last night. This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about. I don\'92t know if there ever was such a thing, but could\'92ve been. If we didn\'92t do the campaign, probably there could\'92ve been. And the history really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks in terms of getting some tremendous people over the finish line. They really are tremendous people, but many of them were not known. But they will be known.\
This election marks the largest Senate gains for a President\'92s party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy\'92s in 1962.\
There have been only four midterm elections since 1934 in which a President\'92s party has gained even a single Senate seat. As of now, we picked up, it looks like, three. Could be four. Perhaps it could be two. But we picked up a lot. And most likely, that number will be three. You people probably know that better than I do at this point, because you\'92ve looked at the more recent numbers.\
Fifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years. In the last 80 years, a sitting President\'92s party has only gained a cumulative total of eight Senate seats, averaging one per decade. So, if we picked up two, three, or four, that\'92s a big percentage of that number. So in the last 80 years \'97 you think of that \'97 only eight seats.\
In President Obama\'92s first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep-blue state of Massachusetts.\
Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents. And these are tremendously talented, hardworking people that did this \'97 Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri. We also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee \'97 I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha \'97 and in Utah. And Arizona is looking very good. Really, very good. She\'92s done a terrific job. That was a tough race, and she\'92s done a fantastic job.\
In each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising and media support. We were getting bombarded with money on the other side.\
In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedents and overcame a historic number of retirements \'97 the most House Republican retirements in 88 years; 43 House Republicans retired.\
Now, I will say this \'97 that, in many cases, they were chairman of committees, and they left because they weren\'92t chairman, because the Republicans have a rule \'97 for six years. And what that does is wonderful in one way; it lets people come through the system and become chairman. And, in another way, it drives people out. Because when they\'92re a chairman, they don\'92t want to go and not be a chairman. You\'92re the chairman of a committee, and you\'92re a big deal, and then all of a sudden you\'92re not doing that anymore. So they leave. We had a lot of them leave. I guess you can flip a coin as to which system is better. The Democrats do the other. Some of their folks have been in these committees for a long time as chairman.\
In 2010, President Obama\'92s first midterm, he lost 63 seats. By contrast, as of the most current count, it looks like around 27 House seats or something. And we\'92ll figure that out pretty soon.\
We also had a slew of historic wins in the governors\'92 races \'97 the governors\'92 races were incredible \'97 against very well-funded, talented, and skilled Democrat candidates and people that worked very, very hard, respectfully, for those candidates, like Oprah Winfrey, who I like. I don\'92t know if she likes me anymore, but that\'92s okay. She used to. But she worked very hard in Georgia. Very, very hard.\
And if you look at them, we won four governors\'92 races crucial to 2020 and the presidential race: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. The big ones: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. Can\'92t get much more important than that. They were incredible. They were actually incredible campaigns, too. Incredible.\
As of right now, Republicans will control the majority of governorships across the country, including three great women who worked very hard: the governors of Alabama, South Dakota, and Iowa. They worked very, very hard. They\'92re very talented.\
By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings. That was a factor. I think maybe a very big factor. The way that was handled, I think, was \'97 tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh. And expressed their support for confirming more great pro-Constitution judges.\
Candidates who embraced our message of low taxes, low regulations, low crime, strong borders, and great judges excelled last night. They excelled. They really \'97 I mean, we have a list of people that were fantastic, and I\'92m just going to point them out: Mike Bost; Rodney Davis; Andy Barr was fantastic. I went to Kentucky \'97 for the most part, I didn\'92t campaign for the House, but I did actually make a special trip for Andy Barr because he was in a very tough race in Kentucky, and he won. That was a very tough race. The polls were all showing that he was down, and down substantially. And he won. And that one, I did do.\
Pete Stauber, of Minnesota. Great guy. He\'92s new and ran a fantastic race.\
On the other hand, you had some that decided to \'93let\'92s stay away.\'94 \'93Let\'92s stay away.\'94 They did very poorly. I\'92m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it.\
Carlos Curbelo; Mike Coffman \'97 too bad, Mike; Mia Love. I saw Mia Love. She\'92d call me all the time to help her with a hostage situation. Being held hostage in Venezuela. But Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\
And Barbara Comstock was another one. I mean, I think she could have run that race, but she didn\'92t want to have any embrace. For that, I don\'92t blame her. But she \'97 she lost. Substantially lost.\
Peter Roskam didn\'92t want the embrace. Erik Paulsen didn\'92t want the embrace. And in New Jersey, I think he could have done well, but didn\'92t work out too good.\
Bob Hugin, I feel badly because I think that\'92s something that could have been won. That\'92s a race that could have been won. That\'92s a race that could have been won. John Faso.\
Those are some of the people that, you know, decided for their own reason not to embrace, whether it\'92s me or what we stand for. But what we stand for meant a lot to most people. And we\'92ve had tremendous support, and tremendous support in the Republican Party. Among the biggest support in the history of the party. I\'92ve actually heard, at 93 percent, it\'92s a record. But I won\'92t say that, because who knows. But we\'92ve had tremendous support.\
America is booming like never before. Doing fantastic. We have Larry Kudlow here, and he said the numbers are as good as he\'92s ever seen \'97 numbers \'97 at any time for our country. But he\'92s a young man, so he hasn\'92t seen that many numbers. (Laughter.) Where\'92s Larry? You\'92re a young man. Right, Larry? And you haven\'92t been doing this too long, but they\'92re as good as you\'92ve ever seen. And we may have \'97 if you have a question for Larry, we\'92ll do that.\
But I want to send my warmest appreciation in regards to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We really worked very well together. We have been working very well together. We actually have a great relationship. People just don\'92t understand that, which is fine.\
And also to, perhaps \'97 it looks like, I would think \'97 Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard, and she\'92s worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she\'92s done and what she\'92s accomplished.\
Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. These are some of things that the Democrats do want to work on, and I really believe we\'92ll be able to do that. I think we\'92re going to have a lot of reason to do it.\
And I will say, just as a matter of business, I was with some very successful people last night. We were watching the returns. So if the Republicans won \'97 and let\'92s say we held on by two, or one, or three \'97 it would\'92ve been very hard out of that many Republicans to ever even get support among Republicans, because there will always be one, or two, or three people that, for a good reason or for a bad reason, or for grandstanding \'97 we have that too; you\'92ve seen that. You\'92ve seen that. Plenty of grandstanding. But for certain reasons that many people \'97 you\'92re always going to have a couple that won\'92t do it. So that puts us in a very bad position.\
In other words, had we kept it, and this is no \'97 I\'92m saying this for very basic reasons, common sense \'97 it puts us in a very tough position. We win by one, or two, or three, and you\'92ll have one, or two, or three, or four or five even, come over and say, you know, \'93Look, we\'92re not going to along with this. We want this, this, this\'85\'94 And all of a sudden, we can\'92t even \'97 we wouldn\'92t even be able to get, in many cases, out of the Republicans\'92 hands before we sent it on to the Senate.\
And now we have a much easier path, because the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for healthcare, a plan for whatever they are looking at, and we\'92ll negotiate. And as you know, it\'92s been very hard in the Senate because we need, essentially, 10 votes from Democrats, and we don\'92t get those votes. Because the Democrats do really stick together well. I don\'92t agree with them on a lot of policy, but I agree with them on sticking together. They stick together great.\
So now we go into the Senate. We don\'92t have the 10 votes. And what happens? It doesn\'92t get passed. Even if it gets out of the House, it doesn\'92t get passed. So under the new concept of what we\'92re doing, I say, \'93Come on. Let me see what you have.\'94 They want to do things. You know, I keep hearing about investigations fatigue. Like from the time \'97 almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they\'92ve been giving us this investigation fatigue. It\'92s been a long time. They got nothing. Zero. You know why? Because there is nothing.\
But they can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate. And a lot of very questionable things were done between leaks of classified information, and many other elements that should not have taken place. And all you\'92re going to do is end up in back and forth, and back and forth. And two years is going to go up, and we won\'92t have done a thing.\
I really think, and I really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting. She used the word \'93uniting\'94 and she used the word the bipartisanship statement, which is so important because that\'92s what we should be doing. So we can look at us, they can look at us, and we can look at them, and it\'92ll go back and forth. And it\'92ll probably be very good for me politically. I could see it being extremely good politically, because I think I\'92m better at that game than they are, actually.\
But we\'92ll find out. I mean, you know, we\'92ll find out. Or we can work together. You can\'92t do them simultaneously, by the way. Just think if somebody said, \'93Oh, you can do them both.\'94 No, you can\'92t. Because if they\'92re doing that, we\'92re not doing the other, just so you understand. So we won\'92t be doing that.\
But now what happens is we send it to the Senate, and we\'92ll get 100 percent Democrat support, and we\'92ll get some Republican support. And if it\'92s good, I really believe we have Republicans that will help with the approval process \'97 and they will really help with the approval process.\
So it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. If we won by one or two or three, or four or five, that wouldn\'92t happen. And the closer it is, the worse it is. This way, they\'92ll come to me, we\'92ll negotiate. Maybe we\'92ll make a deal, maybe we won\'92t. That\'92s possible. But we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.\
We want to do something on healthcare; they want to do something on healthcare. There are a lot of great things that we can do together. And now we\'92ll send it up and we will really get \'97 we\'92ll get the Democrats and we\'92ll get the Republicans, or some of the Republicans. And I\'92ll make sure that we send something up that the Republicans can support, and they\'92re going to want to make sure they send something up that the Democrats can support.\
So our great country is booming like never before, and we\'92re thriving on every single level, both in terms of economic and military strength; in terms of development. In terms of GDP, we\'92re doing unbelievably.\
I will tell you, our trade deals are coming along fantastically. The USMCA and South Korea is finished. USMCA has gotten rave reviews. Not going to lose companies anymore to other countries. They\'92re not going to do that because they have a tremendous economic incentive, meaning it\'92s prohibitive for them to do that.\
So it\'92s not going to be like NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals I\'92ve ever seen \'97 although we\'92ve made some other pretty bad ones too.\
Now is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the American economic miracle going strong. It is a miracle. We\'92re doing so well. And I\'92ve said it at a lot of rallies. Some of you have probably heard it so much you don\'92t want to hear it again. But when people come to my office \'97 presidents, prime ministers \'97 they all congratulate me, almost the first thing, on what we\'92ve done economically. Because it is really amazing.\
And our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.\
We must all work together to protect our military \'97 I have to do that \'97 to support out law enforcement, secure our borders, and advance really great policy, including environmental policy. We want crystal-clean water. We want beautiful, perfect air. Air and water, it has to be perfect.\
At the same time, we don\'92t want to put ourselves at a disadvantage to other countries who are very competitive with us and who don\'92t abide by the rules at all. We don\'92t want to hurt our jobs. We don\'92t want to hurt our factories. We don\'92t want companies leaving. We want to be totally competitive, and we are.\
And right now we have just about the cleanest air, the cleanest water we\'92ve ever had, and it\'92s always going to be that way. We insist on it. So environmental is very important to me.}
