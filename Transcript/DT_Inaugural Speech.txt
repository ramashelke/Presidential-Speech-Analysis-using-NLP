Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.\cb1 \
\cb3 We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.\cb1 \
\cb3 Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\cb1 \
\cb3 Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.\cb1 \
\cb3 Today\'92s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another \'96 but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.\cb1 \
\cb3 For too long, a small group in our nation\'92s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\cb1 \
\cb3 Washington flourished \'96 but the people did not share in its wealth.\cb1 \
\cb3 Politicians prospered \'96 but the jobs left, and the factories closed.\cb1 \
\cb3 The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.\cb1 \
\cb3 Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation\'92s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\cb1 \
\cb3 That all changes \'96 starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.\cb1 \
\cb3 It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 This is your day. This is your celebration.\cb1 \
\cb3 And this, the United States of America, is your country.\cb1 \
\cb3 What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\cb1 \
\cb3 January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\cb1 \
\cb3 Everyone is listening to you now.\cb1 \
\cb3 You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\cb1 \
\cb3 At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.\cb1 \
\cb3 Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\cb1 \
\cb3 These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.\cb1 \
\cb3 But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\cb1 \
\cb3 This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\cb1 \
\cb3 We are one nation \'96 and their pain is our pain.\'a0 Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.\'a0 We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\cb1 \
\cb3 The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb3 For many decades, we\'92ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;\cb1 \
\cb3 Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;\cb1 \
\cb3 We've defended other nation\'92s borders while refusing to defend our own;\cb1 \
\cb3 And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\cb1 \
\cb3 We\'92ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.\cb1 \
\cb3 One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.\cb1 \
\cb3 The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.\cb1 \
\cb3 But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\cb1 \
\cb3 We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.\cb1 \
\cb3 From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\cb1 \
\cb3 From this moment on, it\'92s going to be America First.\cb1 \
\cb3 Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\cb1 \
\cb3 We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.\'a0 Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\cb1 \
\cb3 I will fight for you with every breath in my body \'96 and I will never, ever let you down.\cb1 \
\cb3 America will start winning again, winning like never before.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.\'a0 We will bring back our wealth.\'a0 And we will bring back our dreams.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will get our people off of welfare and back to work \'96 rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world \'96 but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\cb1 \
\cb3 We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones \'96 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\cb1 \
\cb3 At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\cb1 \
\cb3 When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\cb1 \
\cb3 The Bible tells us, \'93how good and pleasant it is when God\'92s people live together in unity.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.\cb1 \
\cb3 When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.\cb1 \
\cb3 There should be no fear \'96 we are protected, and we will always be protected.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.\cb1 \
\cb3 Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.\cb1 \
\cb3 In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action \'96 constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\cb1 \
\cb3 The time for empty talk is over.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now arrives the hour of action.\cb1 \
\cb3 Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.\'a0 No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\cb1 \
\cb3 We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\cb1 \
\cb3 A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\cb1 \
\cb3 It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\cb1 \
\cb3 And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\cb1 \
\cb3 So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\cb1 \
\cb3 You will never be ignored again.\cb1 \
\cb3 Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\cb1 \
\cb3 Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.\cb1 \
\cb3 We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\cb1 \
\cb3 We Will Make America Proud Again.\cb1 \
\cb3 We Will Make America Safe Again.\cb1 \
\cb3 And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.}
