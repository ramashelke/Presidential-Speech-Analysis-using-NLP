\f0\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
My fellow Americans, tonight, I\'92d like to talk with you about immigration.\cb1 \
\cb3 For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. It\'92s kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities \'96- people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose.\cb1 \
\cb3 But today, our immigration system is broken -- and everybody knows it.\cb1 \
\cb3 Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart.\cb1 \
\cb3 It\'92s been this way for decades. And for decades, we haven\'92t done much about it.\cb1 \
\cb3 When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it\'92s been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts.\cb1 \
\cb3 Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasn\'92t perfect. It was a compromise. But it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits.\cb1 \
\cb3 Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President \'96- the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me -\'96 that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tonight, I am announcing those actions.\cb1 \
\cb3 First, we\'92ll build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over.\cb1 \
\cb3 Second, I\'92ll make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed.\cb1 \
\cb3 Third, we\'92ll take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.\cb1 \
\cb3 I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, we\'92re also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable -\'96 especially those who may be dangerous. That\'92s why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And that\'92s why we\'92re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who\'92s working hard to provide for her kids. We\'92ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.\cb1 \
\cb3 But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants in every state, of every race and nationality still live here illegally. And let\'92s be honest -\'96 tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn\'92t realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isn\'92t being straight with you. It\'92s also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: \'93They are a part of American life.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 Now here\'92s the thing: We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So we\'92re going to offer the following deal: If you\'92ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you\'92re willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- you\'92ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. That\'92s what this deal is.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, let\'92s be clear about what it isn\'92t. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive -\'96 only Congress can do that. All we\'92re saying is we\'92re not going to deport you.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, it\'92s not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today -\'96 millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time.\cb1 \
\cb3 That\'92s the real amnesty \'96- leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I\'92m describing is accountability \'96- a common-sense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you\'92re a criminal, you\'92ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.\cb1 \
\cb3 The actions I\'92m taking are not only lawful, they\'92re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill.\cb1 \
\cb3 I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, don\'92t let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. That\'92s not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldn\'92t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose \'96- a higher purpose.\cb1 \
\cb3 Most Americans support the types of reforms I\'92ve talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we don\'92t like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like they\'92ve gotten the raw deal for over a decade. I hear these concerns. But that\'92s not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe it\'92s important that all of us have this debate without impugning each other\'92s character.\cb1 \
\cb3 Because for all the back and forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. It\'92s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations.\cb1 \
\cb3 Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future?\cb1 \
\cb3 Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents\'92 arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works together to keep them together?\cb1 \
\cb3 Are we a nation that educates the world\'92s best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America?\cb1 \
\cb3 That\'92s what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration. We need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it.\cb1 \
\cb3 Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government, and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. I\'92ve seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didn\'92t have the right papers. I\'92ve seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love.\cb1 \
\cb3 These people \'96- our neighbors, our classmates, our friends \'96- they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to America\'92s success.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tomorrow, I\'92ll travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didn\'92t speak any English. She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and she became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mom cleaned other people\'92s homes. They wouldn\'92t let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school, not because they didn\'92t love her, but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant \'96- so she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows \'96- until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldn\'92t travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree.\cb1 \
\cb3 Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid, or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in? Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger \'96- we were strangers once, too.\cb1 \
\cb3 My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal -\'96 that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.\cb1 \
\cb3 That\'92s the country our parents and grandparents and generations before them built for us. That\'92s the tradition we must uphold. That\'92s the legacy we must leave for those who are yet to come.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you. God bless you. And God bless this country we love.\

\f1\fs34 \cf4 If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\cb1 \
\cb3 It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference.\cb1 \
\cb3 It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled \'97 Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of red states and blue states; we are, and always will be, the United States of America.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs28 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs34 \cf4 \cb3 It's the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.\cb1 \
\cb3 It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America.\cb1 \
\cb3 I just received a very gracious call from Sen. McCain. He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader. I congratulate him and Gov. Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.\cb1 \
\cb3 I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the vice-president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.\cb1 \
\cb3 I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation's next first lady, Michelle Obama. Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure.\cb1 \
\cb3 To my campaign manager, David Plouffe; my chief strategist, David Axelrod; and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics \'97 you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.\cb1 \
\cb3 But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to \'97 it belongs to you.\cb1 \
\cb3 I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington \'97 it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston.\cb1 \
\cb3 It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to this cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this earth. This is your victory.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know you didn't do this just to win an election, and I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime \'97 two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for college. There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair.\cb1 \
\cb3 The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year, or even one term, but America \'97 I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you: We as a people will get there.\cb1 \
\cb3 There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president, and we know that government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it's been done in America for 221 years \'97 block by block, brick by brick, callused hand by callused hand.\cb1 \
\cb3 What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek \'97 it is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It cannot happen without you.\cb1 \
\cb3 So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other. Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. In this country, we rise or fall as one nation \'97 as one people.\cb1 \
\cb3 Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House \'97 a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty and national unity. Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.\cb1 \
\cb3 As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, "We are not enemies, but friends... Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection." And, to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your president, too.\cb1 \
\cb3 And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world \'97 our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those who would tear this world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight, we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.\cb1 \
\cb3 For that is the true genius of America \'97 that America can change. Our union can be perfected. And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.\cb1 \
\cb3 This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.\cb1 \
\cb3 She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons \'97 because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.\cb1 \
\cb3 And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America \'97 the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 When there was despair in the Dust Bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that "We Shall Overcome." Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change. Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves: If our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?\cb1 \
\cb3 This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time \'97 to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs40 \cf2 Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States\'97she's around here somewhere:\cb1 \
\cb3 I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so. If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has: a friend, a neighbor, a member of your family. You don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It's the job you thought you'd retire from but now have lost, the business you built your dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread, the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.\cb1 \
\cb3 But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.\cb1 \
\cb3 The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation. The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories and our universities, in our fields and our factories, in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history, we still possess in ample measure. What is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people. I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.\cb1 \
\cb3 The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our Government, than ever before.\cb1 \
\cb3 In other words, we have lived through an era where too often short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time, on some other day. Well, that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is the time to jumpstart job creation, restart lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that is what I'd like to talk to you about tonight. It's an agenda that begins with jobs.\cb1 \
\cb3 As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets, not because I believe in bigger Government\'97I don't\'97not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited\'97I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship. In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. And that's why I pushed for quick action. And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.\cb1 \
\cb3 Over the next 2 years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector: jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges, constructing wind turbines and solar panels, laying broadband and expanding mass transit.\cb1 \
\cb3 Because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids, health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make. Because of this plan, 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut; a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st. Because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all 4 years of college, and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work, and I understand that skepticism. Here in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\cb1 \
\cb3 And that's why I've asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort; because nobody messes with Joe. I\'97am I right? They don't mess with him. I have told each of my Cabinet, as well as mayors and Governors across the country, that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend. I've appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. And we have created a new web site called recovery.gov, so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent.\cb1 \
\cb3 So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.\cb1 \
\cb3 I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family's well-being. You should also know that the money you've deposited in banks across the country is safe, your insurance is secure, you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. That's not the source of concern. The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.\cb1 \
\cb3 You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education, how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.\cb1 \
\cb3 But credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. And with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or even to each other. And when there is no lending, families can't afford to buy homes or cars, so businesses are forced to make layoffs. Our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further. That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, to restore confidence, and restart lending. And we will do so in several ways.\cb1 \
\cb3 First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small-business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running.\cb1 \
\cb3 Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values; Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about. In fact, the average family who refinances today can save nearly $2,000 per year on their mortgage.\cb1 \
\cb3 Third, we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. But such an approach won't solve the problem, and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all.\cb1 \
\cb3 And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.\cb1 \
\cb3 Still, this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government\'97and, yes, probably more than we've already set aside. But while the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed. So were the American taxpayers; so was I. So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you, I get it.\cb1 \
\cb3 But I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment. My job\'97our job is to solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. I will not send\'97I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage. That's what this is about. It's not about helping banks; it's about helping people\'97[applause].\cb1 \
\cb3 It's not about helping banks; it's about helping people. Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend. And if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car or open their own business. Investors will return to the market, and American families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly but surely, confidence will return and our economy will recover.\cb1 \
\cb3 So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary, because we cannot consign our Nation to an open-ended recession. And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new, commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes shortcuts and abuse.\cb1 \
\cb3 The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short term. But the only way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care, the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.\cb1 \
\cb3 In the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress. So often, we've come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs. I see this document differently. I see it as a vision for America, as a blueprint for our future.\cb1 \
\cb3 My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited, a trillion-dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession. Given these realities, everyone in this Chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. And that includes me. But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.\cb1 \
\cb3 For history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of Civil War, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. In the wake of war and depression, the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the Moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world. In each case, Government didn't supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.\cb1 \
\cb3 We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again, and that is why, even as it cuts back on programs we don't need, the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education.\cb1 \
\cb3 It begins with energy. We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy-efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea. Well, I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders, and I know you don't either. It is time for America to lead again.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this Nation's supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years. We've also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history, an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.\cb1 \
\cb3 But to truly transform our economy, to protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. That's what we need. And to support that innovation, we will invest $15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power, advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.\cb1 \
\cb3 Speaking of our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a retooled, reimagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it; scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this is America. We don't do what's easy. We do what's necessary to move this country forward.\cb1 \
\cb3 And for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care. This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes. In the last 8 years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. And in each of these years, 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. And it's one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget. Given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold. We can't afford to do it. It's time.\cb1 \
\cb3 Already, we've done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we've done in the last decade. When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time. Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records, a new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American, including me, by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control.\cb1 \
\cb3 This budget builds on these reforms. It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform, a down payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every American. It's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. And it's a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that's why I'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.\cb1 \
\cb3 I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. Once again, it will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough. So let there be no doubt: Health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.\cb1 \
\cb3 The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America. In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity, it is a prerequisite. Right now, three-quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation, and half of the students who begin college never finish.\cb1 \
\cb3 This is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education, from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. That is a promise we have to make to the children of America.\cb1 \
\cb3 Already, we've made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. We've dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. We've made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students\'977 million. And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress.\cb1 \
\cb3 But we know that our schools don't just need more resources, they need more reform. And that is why this budget creates new teachers\'97new incentives for teacher performance, pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. We'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps, and we will expand our commitment to charter schools.\cb1 \
\cb3 It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a 4-year school, vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.\cb1 \
\cb3 And dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American. That's why we will support\'97we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal. By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is a goal we can meet. That's a goal we can meet.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch, as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country, Senator Edward Kennedy.\cb1 \
\cb3 These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children, but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent, for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the TV, put away the video games, read to their child. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father, when I say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home. That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue; that's an American issue.\cb1 \
\cb3 There is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. And that's the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. That is critical. [Applause] I agree, absolutely. See, I know we can get some consensus in here. [Laughter] With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down. That is critical.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I'm proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities.\cb1 \
\cb3 And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.\cb1 \
\cb3 In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier. We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.\cb1 \
\cb3 In order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Now, let me be clear\'97let me be absolutely clear, because I know you'll end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, a quarter million dollars a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: Not one single dime. In fact\'97not a dime\'97in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut\'97that's right, a tax cut\'97for 95 percent of working families. And by the way, these checks are on the way.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come. And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb3 Finally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules. And for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For 7 years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.\cb1 \
\cb3 Along with our outstanding national security team, I'm now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.\cb1 \
\cb3 And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism, because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one message: We honor your service; we are inspired by your sacrifice; and you have our unyielding support.\cb1 \
\cb3 To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.\cb1 \
\cb3 To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend, because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists. Because living our values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture. We can make that commitment here tonight.\cb1 \
\cb3 In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America. We cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.\cb1 \
\cb3 To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To meet the challenges of the 21st century\'97from terrorism to nuclear proliferation, from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty\'97we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.\cb1 \
\cb3 And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the world depends on us having a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world's.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us, watching to see what we do with this moment, waiting for us to lead. Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege, one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know that it's easy to lose sight of this truth, to become cynical and doubtful, consumed with the petty and the trivial. But in my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places, that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary.\cb1 \
\cb3 I think of Leonard Abess, a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. He didn't tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, "I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. It didn't feel right getting the money myself."\cb1 \
\cb3 I think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community, how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. "The tragedy was terrible," said one of the men who helped them rebuild. "But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity."\cb1 \
\cb3 I think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina, a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She had been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help and says: "We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, Congressmen like yourself, and one day President, so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina but also the world. We are not quitters." That's what she said: "We are not quitters."\cb1 \
\cb3 These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres, a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity. Their resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our cause. And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know\'97look, I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far. [Laughter] There are surely times in the future where we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. I know that. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.\cb1 \
\cb3 And if we do, if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis, if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity, if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very Chamber, "something worthy to be remembered."\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.\

\cf2 Good evening.\'a0 Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who\'92s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history.\'a0 The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction.\cb1 \
\cb3 And yet we know that the worst images are those that were unseen to the world.\'a0 The empty seat at the dinner table.\'a0 Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father.\'a0 Parents who would never know the feeling of their child\'92s embrace.\'a0 Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts.\cb1 \
\cb3 On September 11, 2001, in our time of grief, the American people came together.\'a0 We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood.\'a0 We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country.\'a0 On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.\cb1 \
\cb3 We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice.\'a0 We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda -- an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe.\'a0 And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.\cb1 \
\cb3 Over the last 10 years, thanks to the tireless and heroic work of our military and our counterterrorism professionals, we\'92ve made great strides in that effort.\'a0 We\'92ve disrupted terrorist attacks and strengthened our homeland defense.\'a0 In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban government, which had given bin Laden and al Qaeda safe haven and support.\'a0 And around the globe, we worked with our friends and allies to capture or kill scores of al Qaeda terrorists, including several who were a part of the 9/11 plot.\cb1 \
\cb3 Yet Osama bin Laden avoided capture and escaped across the Afghan border into Pakistan.\'a0 Meanwhile, al Qaeda continued to operate from along that border and operate through its affiliates across the world.\cb1 \
\cb3 And so shortly after taking office, I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al Qaeda, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network.\cb1 \
\cb3 Then, last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden.\'a0 It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground.\'a0 I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan.\'a0 And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.\cb1 \
\cb3 Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\'a0 A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.\'a0 No Americans were harmed.\'a0 They took care to avoid civilian casualties.\'a0 After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\cb1 \
\cb3 For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda\'92s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies.\'a0 The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation\'92s effort to defeat al Qaeda.\cb1 \
\cb3 Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.\'a0 There\'92s no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us.\'a0 We must \'96- and we will -- remain vigilant at home and abroad.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not \'96- and never will be -\'96 at war with Islam.\'a0 I\'92ve made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam.\'a0 Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims.\'a0 Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own.\'a0 So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.\cb1 \
\cb3 Over the years, I\'92ve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was.\'a0 That is what we\'92ve done.\'a0 But it\'92s important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.\'a0 Indeed, bin Laden had declared war against Pakistan as well, and ordered attacks against the Pakistani people.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tonight, I called President Zardari, and my team has also spoken with their Pakistani counterparts.\'a0 They agree that this is a good and historic day for both of our nations.\'a0 And going forward, it is essential that Pakistan continue to join us in the fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates.\cb1 \
\cb3 The American people did not choose this fight.\'a0 It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens.\'a0 After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war.\'a0 These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who\'92s been gravely wounded.\cb1 \
\cb3 So Americans understand the costs of war.\'a0 Yet as a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed.\'a0 We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies.\'a0 We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda\'92s terror:\'a0 Justice has been done.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tonight, we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who\'92ve worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome.\'a0 The American people do not see their work, nor know their names.\'a0 But tonight, they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.\cb1 \
\cb3 We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.\'a0 And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of the burden since that September day.\cb1 \
\cb3 Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11.\'a0 I know that it has, at times, frayed.\'a0 Yet today\'92s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 The cause of securing our country is not complete.\'a0 But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to.\'a0 That is the story of our history, whether it\'92s the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are:\'a0 one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you.\'a0 May God bless you.\'a0 And may God bless the United States of America.\
Thank you, Governor.\'a0 To all the families, first responders, to the community of Newtown, clergy, guests -- Scripture tells us: \'a0\'93\'85do not lose heart. \'a0Though outwardly we are wasting away\'85inwardly we are being renewed day by day.\'a0 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. \'a0So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. \'a0For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.\'a0 They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school; in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America.\cb1 \
\cb3 Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.\'a0 I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.\'a0 I can only hope it helps for you to know that you\'92re not alone in your grief; that our world too has been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, we\'92ve pulled our children tight.\'a0 And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it.\'a0 Newtown -- you are not alone.\cb1 \
\cb3 As these difficult days have unfolded, you\'92ve also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice.\'a0 We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary, the school\'92s staff did not flinch, they did not hesitate.\'a0 Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy -- they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care.\cb1 \
\cb3 We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying \'93wait for the good guys, they\'92re coming\'94; \'93show me your smile.\'94\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 And we know that good guys came.\'a0 The first responders who raced to the scene, helping to guide those in harm\'92s way to safety, and comfort those in need, holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do, and others needed them more.\cb1 \
\cb3 And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding each other, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do; one child even trying to encourage a grown-up by saying, \'93I know karate.\'a0 So it\'92s okay.\'a0 I\'92ll lead the way out.\'94\'a0 (Laughter.)\cb1 \
\cb3 As a community, you\'92ve inspired us, Newtown.\'a0 In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, you\'92ve looked out for each other, and you\'92ve cared for one another, and you\'92ve loved one another.\'a0 This is how Newtown will be remembered.\'a0 And with time, and God\'92s grace, that love will see you through.\cb1 \
\cb3 But we, as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.\'a0 Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time, walking around.\'a0 With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves -- our child -- is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice.\'a0 And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.\'a0 And yet, we also know that with that child\'92s very first step, and each step after that, they are separating from us; that we won\'92t -- that we can\'92t always be there for them.\'a0 They\'92ll suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.\'a0 And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to face the world without fear.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 And we know we can\'92t do this by ourselves.\'a0 It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize, no matter how much you love these kids, you can\'92t do it by yourself.\'a0 That this job of keeping our children safe, and teaching them well, is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation.\'a0 And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we\'92re counting on everybody else to help look after ours; that we\'92re all parents; that they\'92re all our children.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 This is our first task -- caring for our children.\'a0 It\'92s our first job.\'a0 If we don\'92t get that right, we don\'92t get anything right.\'a0 That\'92s how, as a society, we will be judged.\cb1 \
\cb3 And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations?\'a0 Can we honestly say that we\'92re doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm?\'a0 Can we claim, as a nation, that we\'92re all together there, letting them know that they are loved, and teaching them to love in return?\'a0 Can we say that we\'92re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?\cb1 \
\cb3 I\'92ve been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we\'92re honest with ourselves, the answer is no.\'a0 We\'92re not doing enough.\'a0 And we will have to change.\cb1 \
\cb3 Since I\'92ve been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting.\'a0 The fourth time we\'92ve hugged survivors.\'a0 The fourth time we\'92ve consoled the families of victims.\'a0 And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and big cities all across America -- victims whose -- much of the time, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\cb1 \
\cb3 We can\'92t tolerate this anymore.\'a0 These tragedies must end.\'a0 And to end them, we must change.\'a0 We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true.\'a0 No single law -- no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society.\cb1 \
\cb3 But that can\'92t be an excuse for inaction.\'a0 Surely, we can do better than this.\'a0 If there is even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent, or another town, from the grief that has visited Tucson, and Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that -- then surely we have an obligation to try.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.\'a0 Because what choice do we have?\'a0 We can\'92t accept events like this as routine.\'a0 Are we really prepared to say that we\'92re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? \'a0Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?\cb1 \
\cb3 All the world\'92s religions -- so many of them represented here today -- start with a simple question:\'a0 Why are we here?\'a0 What gives our life meaning? \'a0What gives our acts purpose?\'a0 We know our time on this Earth is fleeting.\'a0 We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain; that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it\'92s wealth or power or fame, or just simple comfort, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped.\'a0 We know that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way. \'a0We will make mistakes, we will experience hardships.\'a0 And even when we\'92re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God\'92s heavenly plans.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 There\'92s only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have -- for our children, for our families, for each other.\'a0 The warmth of a small child\'92s embrace -- that is true.\'a0 The memories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves, and binds us to something larger -- we know that\'92s what matters.\'a0 We know we\'92re always doing right when we\'92re taking care of them, when we\'92re teaching them well, when we\'92re showing acts of kindness.\'a0 We don\'92t go wrong when we do that.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 That\'92s what we can be sure of.\'a0 And that\'92s what you, the people of Newtown, have reminded us.\'a0 That\'92s how you\'92ve inspired us.\'a0 You remind us what matters.\'a0 And that\'92s what should drive us forward in everything we do, for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth.\cb1 \
\cb3 \'93Let the little children come to me,\'94 Jesus said, \'93and do not hinder them -- for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\'94\cb1 \
\cb3 Charlotte.\'a0 Daniel.\'a0 Olivia.\'a0 Josephine. \'a0Ana.\'a0 Dylan.\'a0 Madeleine.\'a0 Catherine.\'a0 Chase.\'a0 Jesse.\'a0 James.\'a0 Grace.\'a0 Emilie.\'a0 Jack.\'a0 Noah.\'a0 Caroline.\'a0 Jessica.\'a0 Benjamin.\'a0 Avielle.\'a0 Allison.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 God has called them all home.\'a0 For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on, and make our country worthy of their memory.\cb1 \
\cb3 May God bless and keep those we\'92ve lost in His heavenly place.\'a0 May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort.\'a0 And may He bless and watch over this community, and the United States of America.\
Good afternoon, everybody.\'a0 Last night I had a chance to speak to the leaders of the House and the Senate and reached out to those who had both won and lost in both parties.\'a0 I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell that I look forward to working with them.\'a0 And I thanked Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for their extraordinary leadership over the last two years.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 After what I'm sure was a long night for a lot of you -- and needless to say it was for me -- I can tell you that some election nights are more fun than others.\'a0 Some are exhilarating; some are humbling.\'a0 But every election, regardless of who wins and who loses, is a reminder that in our democracy, power rests not with those of us in elected office, but with the people we have the privilege to serve.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Over the last few months I've had the opportunity to travel around the country and meet people where they live and where they work, from backyards to factory floors.\'a0 I did some talking, but mostly I did a lot of listening.\'a0 And yesterday\'92s vote confirmed what I've heard from folks all across America:\'a0 People are frustrated -- they\'92re deeply frustrated -- with the pace of our economic recovery and the opportunities that they hope for their children and their grandchildren.\'a0 They want jobs to come back faster, they want paychecks to go further, and they want the ability to give their children the same chances and opportunities as they\'92ve had in life.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 The men and women who sent us here don't expect Washington to solve all their problems.\'a0 But they do expect Washington to work for them, not against them.\'a0 They want to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely, not wasted, and that we're not going to leave our children a legacy of debt.\'a0 They want to know that their voices aren\'92t being drowned out by a sea of lobbyists and special interests and partisan bickering.\'a0 They want business to be done here openly and honestly.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, I ran for this office to tackle these challenges and give voice to the concerns of everyday people.\'a0 Over the last two years, we\'92ve made progress.\'a0 But, clearly, too many Americans haven\'92t felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday. And as President, I take responsibility for that.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here, that we must find common ground in order to set -- in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges.\'a0 And I told John Boehner and Mitch McConnell last night I am very eager to sit down with members of both parties and figure out how we can move forward together.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I\'92m not suggesting this will be easy.\'a0 I won\'92t pretend that we will be able to bridge every difference or solve every disagreement.\'a0 There\'92s a reason we have two parties in this country, and both Democrats and Republicans have certain beliefs and certain principles that each feels cannot be compromised.\'a0 But what I think the American people are expecting, and what we owe them, is to focus on those issues that affect their jobs, their security, and their future:\'a0 reducing our deficit, promoting a clean energy economy, making sure that our children are the best educated in the world, making sure that we\'92re making the investments in technology that will allow us to keep our competitive edge in the global economy. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Because the most important contest we face is not the contest between Democrats and Republicans.\'a0 In this century, the most important competition we face is between America and our economic competitors around the world.\'a0 To win that competition, and to continue our economic leadership, we\'92re going to need to be strong and we\'92re going to need to be united.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 None of the challenges we face lend themselves to simple solutions or bumper-sticker slogans.\'a0 Nor are the answers found in any one particular philosophy or ideology.\'a0 As I\'92ve said before, no person, no party, has a monopoly on wisdom.\'a0 And that\'92s why I\'92m eager to hear good ideas wherever they come from, whoever proposes them. And that\'92s why I believe it\'92s important to have an honest and civil debate about the choices that we face.\'a0 That\'92s why I want to engage both Democrats and Republicans in serious conversations about where we\'92re going as a nation.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And with so much at stake, what the American people don\'92t want from us, especially here in Washington, is to spend the next two years refighting the political battles of the last two.\'a0 We just had a tough election.\'a0 We will have another in 2012.\'a0 I\'92m not so na\'efve as to think that everybody will put politics aside until then, but I do hope to make progress on the very serious problems facing us right now. And that\'92s going to require all of us, including me, to work harder at building consensus.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 You know, a little over a month ago, we held a town hall meeting in Richmond, Virginia.\'a0 And one of the most telling questions came from a small business owner who runs a tree care firm.\'a0 He told me how hard he works and how busy he was; how he doesn\'92t have time to pay attention to all the back-and-forth in Washington.\'a0 And he asked, is there hope for us returning to civility in our discourse, to a healthy legislative process, so as I strap on the boots again tomorrow, I know that you guys got it under control?\'a0 It\'92s hard to have a faith in that right now, he said.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I do believe there is hope for civility.\'a0 I do believe there\'92s hope for progress.\'a0 And that\'92s because I believe in the resiliency of a nation that\'92s bounced back from much worse than what we\'92re going through right now -- a nation that's overcome war and depression, that has been made more perfect in our struggle for individual rights and individual freedoms. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Each time progress has come slowly and even painfully, but progress has always come -- because we\'92ve worked at it and because we\'92ve believed in it, and most of all, because we remembered that our first allegiance as citizens is not to party or region or faction, but to country -- because while we may be proud Democrats or proud Republicans, we are prouder to be Americans. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And that's something that we all need to remember right now and in the coming months.\'a0 And if we do, I have no doubt that we will continue this nation\'92s long journey towards a better future.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So with that, let me take some questions.\'a0 I\'92m going to start off with Ben Feller at AP.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 Are you willing to concede at all that what happened last night was not just an expression of frustration about the economy, but a fundamental rejection of your agenda?\'a0 And given the results, who do you think speaks to the true voice of the American people right now:\'a0 you or John Boehner?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 I think that there is no doubt that people\'92s number-one concern is the economy.\'a0 And what they were expressing great frustration about is the fact that we haven\'92t made enough progress on the economy.\'a0 We\'92ve stabilized the economy. We\'92ve got job growth in the private sectors.\'a0 But people all across America aren\'92t feeling that progress.\'a0 They don't see it.\'a0 And they understand that I\'92m the President of the United States, and that my core responsibility is making sure that we\'92ve got an economy that's growing, a middle class that feels secure, that jobs are being created.\'a0 And so I think I've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, moving forward, I think the question is going to be can Democrats and Republicans sit down together and come up with a set of ideas that address those core concerns.\'a0 I'm confident that we can. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I think that there are some areas where it\'92s going to be very difficult for us to agree on, but I think there are going to be a whole bunch of areas where we can agree on.\'a0 I don\'92t think there\'92s anybody in America who thinks that we\'92ve got an energy policy that works the way it needs to; that thinks that we shouldn\'92t be working on energy independence.\'a0 And that gives opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to come together and think about, whether it\'92s natural gas or energy efficiency or how we can build electric cars in this country, how do we move forward on that agenda.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I think everybody in this country thinks that we\'92ve got to make sure our kids are equipped in terms of their education, their science background, their math backgrounds, to compete in this new global economy.\'a0 And that\'92s going to be an area where I think there\'92s potential common ground.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So on a whole range of issues, there are going to be areas where we disagree.\'a0 I think the overwhelming message that I hear from the voters is that we want everybody to act responsibly in Washington.\'a0 We want you to work harder to arrive at consensus.\'a0 We want you to focus completely on jobs and the economy and growing it, so that we\'92re ensuring a better future for our children and our grandchildren.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And I think that there\'92s no doubt that as I reflect on the results of the election, it underscores for me that I've got to do a better job, just like everybody else in Washington does.\cb1 \
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 (Inaudible.)\cb1 \
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, I think John Boehner and I and Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are going to have to sit down and work together -- because I suspect that if you talk to any individual voter yesterday, they\'92d say, there are some things I agree with Democrats on, there are some things I agree with Republicans on.\'a0 I don\'92t think people carry around with them a fixed ideology.\'a0 I think the majority of people, they\'92re going about their business, going about their lives.\'a0 They just want to make sure that we\'92re making progress.\'a0 And that\'92s going to be my top priority over the next couple of years.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Savannah Guthrie.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Just following up on what Ben just talked about, you don\'92t seem to be reflecting or second-guessing any of the policy decisions you\'92ve made, instead saying the message the voters were sending was about frustration with the economy or maybe even chalking it up to a failure on your part to communicate effectively. If you\'92re not reflecting on your policy agenda, is it possible voters can conclude you\'92re still not getting it?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, Savannah, that was just the first question, so we\'92re going to have a few more here.\'a0 I\'92m doing a whole lot of reflecting and I think that there are going to be areas in policy where we\'92re going to have to do a better job. I think that over the last two years, we have made a series of very tough decisions, but decisions that were right in terms of moving the country forward in an emergency situation where we had the risk of slipping into a second Great Depression.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 But what is absolutely true is that with all that stuff coming at folks fast and furious -- a recovery package, what we had to do with respect to the banks, what we had to do with respect to the auto companies -- I think people started looking at all this and it felt as if government was getting much more intrusive into people\'92s lives than they were accustomed to. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, the reason was it was an emergency situation.\'a0 But I think it\'92s understandable that folks said to themselves, you know, maybe this is the agenda, as opposed to a response to an emergency.\'a0 And that\'92s something that I think everybody in the White House understood was a danger.\'a0 We thought it was necessary, but I\'92m sympathetic to folks who looked at it and said this is looking like potential overreach. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 In addition, there were a bunch of price tags that went with that.\'a0 And so, even though these were emergency situations, people rightly said, gosh, we already have all this debt, we already have these big deficits; this is potentially going to compound it, and at what point are we going to get back to a situation where we\'92re doing what families all around the country do, which is make sure that if you spend something you know how to pay for it -- as opposed to racking up the credit card for the next generation.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And I think that the other thing that happened is that when I won election in 2008, one of the reasons I think that people were excited about the campaign was the prospect that we would change how business is done in Washington.\'a0 And we were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn\'92t change how things got done.\'a0 And I think that frustrated people.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I\'92m a strong believer that the earmarking process in Congress isn\'92t what the American people really want to see when it comes to making tough decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent.\'a0 And I, in the rush to get things done, had to sign a bunch of bills that had earmarks in them, which was contrary to what I had talked about.\'a0 And I think folks look at that and they said, gosh, this feels like the same partisan squabbling, this seems like the same ways of doing business as happened before.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And so one of the things that I\'92ve got to take responsibility for is not having moved enough on those fronts.\'a0 And I think there is an opportunity to move forward on some of those issues.\'a0 My understanding is Eric Cantor today said that he wanted to see a moratorium on earmarks continuing.\'a0 That\'92s something I think we can -- we can work on together.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Would you still resist the notion that voters rejected the policy choices you made?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, Savannah, I think that what I think is absolutely true is voters are not satisfied with the outcomes.\'a0 If right now we had 5 percent unemployment instead of 9.6 percent unemployment, then people would have more confidence in those policy choices.\'a0 The fact is, is that for most folks, proof of whether they work or not is has the economy gotten back to where it needs to be.\'a0 And it hasn\'92t.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And so my job is to make sure that I\'92m looking at all ideas that are on the table.\'a0 When it comes to job creation, if Republicans have good ideas for job growth that can drive down the unemployment rate, and we haven\'92t thought of them, we haven\'92t looked at them but we think they have a chance of working, we want to try some.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So on the policy front, I think the most important thing is to say that we\'92re not going to rule out ideas because they\'92re Democrat or Republican; we want to just see what works.\'a0 And ultimately, I\'92ll be judged as President as to the bottom line, results.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Mike Emanuel.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 Health care -- as you\'92re well aware, obviously, a lot of Republicans ran against your health care law.\'a0 Some have called for repealing the law.\'a0 I\'92m wondering, sir, if you believe that health care reform that you worked so hard on is in danger at this point, and whether there\'92s a threat, as a result of this election.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, I know that there\'92s some Republican candidates who won last night who feel very strongly about it.\'a0 I\'92m sure that this will be an issue that comes up in discussions with the Republican leadership.\'a0 As I said before, though, I think we\'92d be misreading the election if we thought that the American people want to see us for the next two years relitigate arguments that we had over the last two years.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 With respect to the health care law, generally -- and this may go to some of the questions that Savannah was raising -- you know, when I talk to a woman from New Hampshire who doesn\'92t have to mortgage her house because she got cancer and is seeking treatment but now is able to get health insurance, when I talk to parents who are relieved that their child with a preexisting condition can now stay on their policy until they\'92re 26 years old and give them time to transition to find a job that will give them health insurance, or the small businesses that are now taking advantage of the tax credits that are provided -- then I say to myself, this was the right thing to do.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, if the Republicans have ideas for how to improve our health care system, if they want to suggest modifications that would deliver faster and more effective reform to a health care system that has been wildly expensive for too many families and businesses and certainly for our federal government, I\'92m happy to consider some of those ideas. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 You know, for example, I know one of the things that\'92s come up is that the 1099 provision in the health care bill appears to be too burdensome for small businesses.\'a0 It just involves too much paperwork, too much filing.\'a0 It\'92s probably counterproductive. It was designed to make sure that revenue was raised to help pay for some of the other provisions, but if it ends up just being so much trouble that small businesses find it difficult to manage, that's something that we should take a look at.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So there are going to be examples where I think we can tweak and make improvements on the progress that we\'92ve made.\'a0 That's true for any significant piece of legislation. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 But I don't think that if you ask the American people, should we stop trying to close the doughnut hole that will help senior citizens get prescription drugs, should we go back to a situation where people with preexisting conditions can\'92t get health insurance, should we allow insurance companies to drop your coverage when you get sick even though you\'92ve been paying premiums -- I don't think that you\'92d have a strong vote for people saying those are provisions I want to eliminate.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to some exit polls, sir, about one out of two voters apparently said that they would like to either see it overturned or repealed.\'a0 Are you concerned that that may embolden voters who are from the other party perhaps?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, it also means one out of two voters think it was the right thing to do.\'a0 And obviously this is an issue that has been contentious.\'a0 But as I said, I think what's going to be useful is for us to go through the issues that Republicans have issues on -- not sort of talking generally, but let\'92s talk specifics.\'a0 Does this particular provision -- when it comes to preexisting conditions, is this something you\'92re for or you\'92re against?\'a0 Helping seniors get their prescription drugs -- does that make sense or not?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And if we take that approach -- which is different from campaigning -- I mean, this is now governing -- then I think that we can continue to make some progress and find some common ground.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Chip Reid.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 Republicans say more than anything else what this election was about was spending.\'a0 And they say it will be when hell freezes over that they will accept anything remotely like a stimulus bill or any kind of a proposal you have out there to stimulate job growth through spending.\'a0 Do you accept the fact that any kind of spending to create jobs is dead at this point?\'a0 And if so, what else can government do to create jobs, which is the number one issue?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, I think this is going to be an important question for Democrats and Republicans. I think the American people are absolutely concerned about spending and debt -- and deficits.\'a0 And I\'92m going to have a deficit commission that is putting forward its ideas.\'a0 It\'92s a bipartisan group that includes Republican and Democratic members of Congress.\'a0 Hopefully they were able to arrive at some consensus on some areas where we can eliminate programs that don\'92t work, cut back on government spending that is inefficient, can streamline government, but isn\'92t cutting into the core investments that are going to make sure that we are a competitive economy that is growing and providing opportunity for years to come.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So the question I think that my Republican friends and me and Democratic leaders are going to have answer is, what are our priorities?\'a0 What do we care about?\'a0 And that\'92s going to be a tough debate, because there are some tough choices here. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 We already had a big deficit that I inherited, and that has been made worse because of the recession.\'a0 As we bring it down, I want to make sure that we\'92re not cutting into education that is going to help define whether or not we can compete around the world.\'a0 I don\'92t think we should be cutting back on research and development, because if we can develop new technologies in areas like clean energy, that could make all the difference in terms of job creation here at home.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I think the proposal that I put forward with respect to infrastructure is one that historically we\'92ve had bipartisan agreement about.\'a0 And we should be able to agree now that it makes no sense for China to have better rail systems than us, and Singapore having better airports than us.\'a0 And we just learned that China now has the fastest supercomputer on Earth -- that used to be us.\'a0 They\'92re making investments because they know those investments will pay off over the long term.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And so in these budget discussions, the key is to be able to distinguish between stuff that isn\'92t adding to our growth, isn\'92t an investment in our future, and those things that are absolutely necessary for us to be able to increase job growth in the future as well.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, the single most important thing I think we need to do economically -- and this is something that has to be done during the lame duck session -- is making sure that taxes don\'92t go up on middle-class families next year.\'a0 And so we\'92ve got some work to do on that front to make sure that families not only aren't seeing a higher tax burden -- which will automatically happen if Congress doesn\'92t act -- but also making sure that business provisions that historically we have extended each year that, for example, provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States in research and development, that those are extended.\'a0 I think it makes sense for us to extend unemployment insurance because there are still a lot of folks out there hurting.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So there are some things that we can do right now that will help sustain the recovery and advance it, even as we\'92re also sitting down and figuring out, okay, over the next several years what kinds of budget cuts can we make that are intelligent, that are smart, that won\'92t be undermining our recovery but, in fact, will be encouraging job growth.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 But most of those things that you just called investments they call wasteful spending and they say it\'92s dead on arrival.\'a0 It sounds like -- without their support, you can\'92t get any of it through.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, what is absolutely true is, is that without any Republican support on anything, then it\'92s going to be hard to get things done.\'a0 But I\'92m not going to anticipate that they\'92re not going to support anything.\'a0 I think that part of the message sent to Republicans was we want to see stronger job growth in this country.\'a0 And if there are good ideas about putting people to work that traditionally have garnered Republican support and that don\'92t add to the deficit, then my hope is and expectation is, is that that\'92s something they\'92re willing to have a serious conversation about.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 When it comes to, for example, the proposal we put forward to accelerate depreciation for business, so that if they\'92re building a plant or investing in new equipment next year, that they can take a complete write-off next year, get a huge tax break next year, and that would then encourage a lot of businesses to get off the sidelines -- that's not historically considered a liberal idea.\'a0 That's actually an idea that business groups and Republicans I think have supported for a very long time.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So again, the question is going to be do we all come to the table with an open mind and say to ourselves, what do we think is actually going to make a difference for the American people? That's how we\'92re going to be judged over the next couple of years.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Peter Baker.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 After your election two years ago, when you met with Republicans you said that, in discussing what policies might go forward, that elections have consequences, and that you pointed out that you had won.\'a0 I wonder what consequences you think this election should have then, in terms of your policies.\'a0 Are there areas that you\'92re willing -- can you name today areas that you would be willing to compromise on that you might not have been willing to compromise on in the past?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, I think I\'92ve been willing to compromise in the past and I'm going to be willing to compromise going forward on a whole range of issues.\'a0 Let me give you an example -- the issue of energy that I just mentioned. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I think there are a lot of Republicans that ran against the energy bill that passed in the House last year.\'a0 And so it\'92s doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the House this year or next year or the year after.\'a0 But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy.\'a0 And so let\'92s find those areas where we can agree.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 We\'92ve got, I think, broad agreement that we\'92ve got terrific natural gas resources in this country.\'a0 Are we doing everything we can to develop those?\'a0 There's a lot of agreement around the need to make sure that electric cars are developed here in the United States, that we don't fall behind other countries.\'a0 Are there things that we can do to encourage that?\'a0 And there's already been bipartisan interest on those issues.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 There's been discussion about how we can restart our nuclear industry as a means of reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse gases.\'a0 Is that an area where we can move forward?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 We were able, over the last two years, to increase for the first time in 30 years fuel-efficiency standards on cars and trucks.\'a0 We didn\'92t even need legislation.\'a0 We just needed the cooperation of automakers and autoworkers and investors and other shareholders.\'a0 And that's going to move us forward in a serious way.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So I think when it comes to something like energy, what we\'92re probably going to have to do is say here are some areas where there's just too much disagreement between Democrats and Republicans, we can\'92t get this done right now, but let\'92s not wait.\'a0 Let\'92s go ahead and start making some progress on the things that we do agree on, and we can continue to have a strong and healthy debate about those areas where we don\'92t.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Is there anything in the \'93Pledge to America\'94 that you think you can support?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 You know, I\'92m sure there are going to be areas, particularly around, for example, reforming how Washington works, that I\'92ll be interested in.\'a0 I think the American people want to see more transparency, more openness.\'a0 As I said, in the midst of economic crisis, I think one of the things I take responsibility for is not having pushed harder on some of those issues.\'a0 And I think if you take Republicans and Democrats at their word this is an area that they want to deliver on for the American people, I want to be supportive of that effort.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Jake Tapper.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 I have a policy question and a personal one.\'a0 The policy question is, you talked about how the immediate goal is the Bush tax cuts and making sure that they don\'92t expire for those who earn under $200,000, $250,000.\'a0 Republicans disagree with that strongly.\'a0 They want all of the Bush tax cuts extended.\'a0 Are you willing to compromise on that? Are you willing to negotiate at all, for instance, allow them to expire for everyone over $1 million?\'a0 Where are you willing to budge on that?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And the second one is, President Bush when he went through a similar thing came out and he said this was a \'93thumpin\'92.\'94\'a0 You talked about how it was humbling, or you alluded to it perhaps being humbling.\'a0 And I\'92m wondering, when you call your friends, like Congressman Perriello or Governor Strickland, and you see 19 state legislatures go to the other side, governorships in swing states, the Democratic Party set back, what does it feel like?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 It feels bad.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 You know, the toughest thing over the last couple of days is seeing really terrific public servants not have the opportunity to serve anymore, at least in the short term.\'a0 And you mentioned -- there are just some terrific members of Congress who took really tough votes because they thought it was the right thing, even though they knew this could cause them political problems, and even though a lot of them came from really tough swing districts or majority-Republican districts.\'a0 And the amount of courage that they showed and conviction that they showed is something that I admire so much.\'a0 I can\'92t overstate it.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And so there is a not only sadness about seeing them go, but there\'92s also a lot of questioning on my part in terms of could I have done something differently or done something more so that those folks would still be here. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 It\'92s hard.\'a0 And I take responsibility for it in a lot of ways. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 I will tell you, they\'92ve been incredibly gracious when I have conversations with them.\'a0 And what they\'92ve told me is, you know, we don\'92t have regrets because I feel like we were doing the right thing.\'a0 And they may be just saying that to make me feel better, which, again, is a sign of their character and their class.\'a0 And I hope a lot of them continue to pursue public service because I think they\'92re terrific public servants.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 With respect to the tax cut issue, my goal is to make sure that we don\'92t have a huge spike in taxes for middle-class families.\'a0 Not only would that be a terrible burden on families who are already going through tough times, it would be bad for our economy.\'a0 It is very important that we\'92re not taking a whole bunch of money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money on goods, services, groceries, buying a new winter coat for the kids.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 That\'92s also why I think unemployment insurance is important. Not only is it the right thing to do for folks who are still looking for work and struggling in this really tough economy, but it\'92s the right thing to do for the economy as a whole.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So my goal is to sit down with Speaker-elect Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Harry and Nancy sometime in the next few weeks and see where we can move forward in a way that, first of all, does no harm; that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middle-class families; also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest, and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And how that negotiation works itself out I think is too early to say.\'a0 But this is going to be one of my top priorities, and my hope is, is that given we all have an interest in growing the economy and encouraging job growth, that we\'92re not going to play brinksmanship but instead we\'92re going to act responsibly.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 So you\'92re willing to negotiate?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Absolutely.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Laura Meckler.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 You said earlier that it was clear that Congress was rejecting the idea of a cap-and-trade program, and that you wouldn\'92t be able to move forward with that. Looking ahead, do you feel the same way about EPA regulating carbon emissions?\'a0 Would you be open to them doing essentially the same thing through an administrative action, or is that off the table, as well? \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And secondly, just to follow up on what you said about changing the way Washington works, do you think that -- you said you didn\'92t do enough to change the way things were handled in this city.\'a0 Some of -- in order to get your health care bill passed you needed to make some of those deals.\'a0 Do you wish, in retrospect, you had not made those deals even if it meant the collapse of the program?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 I think that making sure that families had security and were on a trajectory to lower health care costs was absolutely critical for this country.\'a0 But you are absolutely right that when you are navigating through a House and a Senate in this kind of pretty partisan environment that it\'92s a ugly mess when it comes to process.\'a0 And I think that is something that really affected how people viewed the outcome.\'a0 That is something that I regret -- that we couldn\'92t have made the process more -- healthier than it ended up being.\'a0 But I think the outcome was a good one. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 With respect to the EPA, I think the smartest thing for us to do is to see if we can get Democrats and Republicans in a room who are serious about energy independence and are serious about keeping our air clean and our water clean and dealing with the issue of greenhouse gases -- and seeing are there ways that we can make progress in the short term and invest in technologies in the long term that start giving us the tools to reduce greenhouse gases and solve this problem.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 The EPA is under a court order that says greenhouse gases are a pollutant that fall under their jurisdiction. And I think one of the things that's very important for me is not to have us ignore the science, but rather to find ways that we can solve these problems that don\'92t hurt the economy, that encourage the development of clean energy in this country, that, in fact, may give us opportunities to create entire new industries and create jobs that -- and that put us in a competitive posture around the world.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So I think it\'92s too early to say whether or not we can make some progress on that front.\'a0 I think we can.\'a0 Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way.\'a0 It was a means, not an end.\'a0 And I\'92m going to be looking for other means to address this problem.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And I think EPA wants help from the legislature on this.\'a0 I don\'92t think that the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here.\'a0 I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue is being dealt with.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Ed Henry.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 Thank you, Mr. President.\'a0 I wanted to do a personal and policy one as well.\'a0 On personal, you had a lot of fun on the campaign trail by saying that the Republicans were drinking a Slurpee and sitting on the sidelines while you were trying to pull the car out of the ditch.\'a0 But the point of the story was that you said if you want to go forward, you put the car in \'93D\'94; if you want to go backwards, you put it in \'93R.\'94\'a0 Now that there are least 60 House districts that seem to have rejected that message, is it possible that there are a majority of Americans who think your policies are taking us in reverse?\'a0 And what specific changes will you make to your approach to try to fix that and better connect with the American people?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 And just on a policy front, \'93don\'92t ask, don\'92t tell\'94 is something that you promised to end.\'a0 And when you had 60 votes and 59 votes in the Senate -- it\'92s a tough issue -- you haven\'92t been able to do it.\'a0 Do you now have to tell your liberal base that with maybe 52 or 53 votes in the Senate, you\'92re just not going to be able to get it done in the next two years?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Well, let me take the second issue first.\'a0 I\'92ve been a strong believer in the notion that if somebody is willing to serve in our military, in uniform, putting their lives on the line for our security, that they should not be prevented from doing so because of their sexual orientation.\'a0 And since there\'92s been a lot of discussion about polls over the last 48 hours, I think it\'92s worth noting that the overwhelming majority of Americans feel the same way.\'a0 It\'92s the right thing to do.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, as Commander-in-Chief, I\'92ve said that making this change needs to be done in an orderly fashion.\'a0 I\'92ve worked with the Pentagon, worked with Secretary Gates, worked with Admiral Mullen to make sure that we are looking at this in a systemic way that maintains good order and discipline, but that we need to change this policy. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 There\'92s going to be a review that comes out at the beginning of the month that will have surveyed attitudes and opinions within the armed forces.\'a0 I will expect that Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen will have something to say about that review.\'a0 I will look at it very carefully.\'a0 But that will give us time to act in -- potentially during the lame duck session to change this policy. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Keep in mind we\'92ve got a bunch of court cases that are out there as well.\'a0 And something that would be very disruptive to good order and discipline and unit cohesion is if we\'92ve got this issue bouncing around in the courts, as it already has over the last several weeks, where the Pentagon and the chain of command doesn\'92t know at any given time what rules they\'92re working under. \'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 We need to provide certainty and it\'92s time for us to move this policy forward.\'a0 And this should not be a partisan issue.\'a0 This is an issue, as I said, where you\'92ve got a sizable portion of the American people squarely behind the notion that folks who are willing to serve on our behalf should be treated fairly and equally.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Now, in terms of how we move forward, I think that the American people understand that we\'92re still digging our way out of a pretty big mess.\'a0 So I don\'92t think anybody denies they think we\'92re in a ditch.\'a0 I just don\'92t think they feel like we\'92ve gotten all the way out of the ditch yet.\'a0 And to move the analogy forward that I used in the campaign, I think what they want right now is the Democrats and the Republicans both pushing some more to get the car on level ground.\'a0 And we haven\'92t done that. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 If you think I was engaging in too much campaign rhetoric, saying the Republicans were just sitting on the side of the road, watching us get that car out of the ditch, at the very least we were pushing in opposite directions.\'a0 And so --\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Q\'a0\'a0\'a0 -- the idea that your policies are taking the country in reverse.\'a0 You just reject that idea altogether that your policies could be going in reverse?\cb1 \
\
\cb3 THE PRESIDENT:\'a0 Yes.\'a0 And I think, look, here\'92s the bottom line.\'a0 When I came into office, this economy was in a freefall, and the economy has stabilized.\'a0 The economy is growing.\'a0 We\'92ve seen nine months of private sector job growth.\'a0 So I think it would be hard to argue that we\'92re going backwards.\'a0 I think what you can argue is we\'92re stuck in neutral.\'a0 We are not moving the way we need to, to make sure that folks have the jobs, have the opportunity, are seeing economic growth in their communities the way they need to.\'a0 And that's going to require Democrats and Republicans to come together and look for the best ideas to move things forward.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 It will not be easy, not just because Democrats and Republicans may have different priorities, as we were just discussing when it came to how we structure tax cuts, but because these issues are hard. \'a0\cb1 \
\
\cb3 The Republicans throughout the campaign said they\'92re very concerned about debt and deficits.\'a0 Well, one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficits is economic growth.\'a0 So what other proposals do they have to grow the economy? If, in fact, they\'92re rejecting some of the proposals I\'92ve made, I want to hear from them what affirmative policies can make a difference in terms of encouraging job growth and promoting the economy -- because I don't think that tax cuts alone are going to be a recipe for the kind of expansion that we need.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 From 2001 to 2009, we cut taxes pretty significantly, and we just didn\'92t see the kind of expansion that is going to be necessary in terms of driving the unemployment rate down significantly.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 So I think what we\'92re going to need to do and what the American people want is for us to mix and match ideas, figure out those areas where we can agree on, move forward on those, disagree without being disagreeable on those areas that we can\'92t agree on.\'a0 If we accomplish that, then there will be time for politics later, but over the next year I think we can solidify this recovery and give people a little more confidence out there.\

\fs32 \cf4 \cb1 Happy holidays.\'a0 We are just thrilled to have all of you here. \'a0\
\
Thank you, Secretary Salazar, for the kind introduction and for all that you\'92re doing to protect our national parks and our public lands for the future generations.\'a0 I also want to recognize Neil Mulholland and everyone at the National Park Foundation and at the National Park Service who helped put this event together. \'a0\
\
\
I want to thank Pastor Darrell Morton for that wonderful invocation, and of course, thanks to Common and all of tonight\'92s performers for joining us here as we light the National Christmas Tree for the 88th time.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 \'a0\
\
This is a very proud holiday tradition.\'a0 Snow or shine, in good times and in periods of hardship, folks like you have gathered with Presidents to light our national tree.\'a0 Now, it hasn\'92t always gone off without a hitch.\'a0 On one occasion, two sheep left the safety of the Nativity scene and wandered into rush-hour traffic.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 That caused some commotion.\'a0 (Laughter.)\
\
Often, the ceremony itself has reflected the pain and sacrifice of the times.\'a0 There were years during the Second World War when no lights were hung, in order to save electricity.\'a0 In the days following Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill joined President Roosevelt to wish our nation a Happy Christmas even in such perilous days.\
\
But without fail, each year, we have gathered here.\'a0 Each year we\'92ve come together to celebrate a story that has endured for two millennia.\'a0 It\'92s a story that\'92s dear to Michelle and me as Christians, but it\'92s a message that's universal:\'a0 A child was born far from home to spread a simple message of love and redemption to every human being around the world.\
\
It\'92s a message that says no matter who we are or where we are from, no matter the pain we endure or the wrongs we face, we are called to love one another as brothers and as sisters. \'a0\
\
And so during a time in which we try our hardest to live with a spirit of charity and goodwill, we remember our brothers and sisters who have lost a job or are struggling to make ends meet.\'a0 We pray for the men and women in uniform serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and in faraway places who can\'92t be home this holiday season.\'a0 And we thank their families, who will mark this Christmas with an empty seat at the dinner table.\
\
On behalf of Malia, Sasha, Michelle, Marian -- who\'92s our grandmother-in-chief -- (laughter) -\'96 and Bo -- don\'92t forget Bo\'a0 -- (applause) -- I wish all of you a merry Christmas and a blessed holiday season. \'a0\
\
And now I\'92m going to invite the entire Obama crew up here to help me light this Christmas tree.\'a0 (Applause.) \'a0\
\
All right, everybody, we\'92re going to count from five -- five, four, three, two, one.\
\
(The tree is lit.)\'a0 (Applause.) \'a0\
\
Merry Christmas, everybody! \'a0\
Thank you.\'a0 Well, good morning.\'a0 Giving all praise and honor to God.\'a0 It is wonderful to be back with you here.\'a0 I want to thank our co-chairs, Bob and Roger.\'a0 These two don\'92t always agree in the Senate, but in coming together and uniting us all in prayer, they embody the spirit of our gathering today.\'a0\
I also want to thank everybody who helped organize this breakfast.\'a0 It\'92s wonderful to see so many friends and faith leaders and dignitaries.\'a0 And Michelle and I are truly honored to be joining you here today.\
I want to offer a special welcome to a good friend, His Holiness the Dalai Lama -- who is a powerful example of what it means to practice compassion, who inspires us to speak up for the freedom and dignity of all human beings.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 I\'92ve been pleased to welcome him to the White House on many occasions, and we\'92re grateful that he\'92s able to join us here today.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0\'a0\
There aren\'92t that many occasions that bring His Holiness under the same roof as NASCAR.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 This may be the first.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 But God works in mysterious ways.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0\'a0 And so I want to thank Darrell for that wonderful presentation.\'a0 Darrell knows that when you\'92re going 200 miles an hour, a little prayer cannot hurt.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 I suspect that more than once, Darrell has had the same thought as many of us have in our own lives -- Jesus, take the wheel.\'a0 (Laughter.) Although I hope that you kept your hands on the wheel when you were thinking that.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0\'a0\'a0\
He and I obviously share something in having married up.\'a0 And we are so grateful to Stevie for the incredible work that they\'92ve done together to build a ministry where the fastest drivers can slow down a little bit, and spend some time in prayer and reflection and thanks.\'a0 And we certainly want to wish Darrell a happy birthday.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 Happy birthday.\
I will note, though, Darrell, when you were reading that list of things folks were saying about you, I was thinking, well, you're a piker.\'a0 I mean, that -- (laughter.)\'a0 I mean, if you really want a list, come talk to me.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 Because that ain\'92t nothing.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 That's the best they can do in NASCAR?\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\
Slowing down and pausing for fellowship and prayer -- that's what this breakfast is about.\'a0 I think it's fair to say Washington moves a lot slower than NASCAR.\'a0 Certainly my agenda does sometimes.\'a0 (Laughter.)\'a0 But still, it\'92s easier to get caught up in the rush of our lives, and in the political back-and-forth that can take over this city.\'a0 We get sidetracked with distractions, large and small.\'a0 We can\'92t go 10 minutes without checking our smartphones -- and for my staff, that's every 10 seconds.\'a0 And so for 63 years, this prayer tradition has brought us together, giving us the opportunity to come together in humility before the Almighty and to be reminded of what it is that we share as children of God.\'a0\
And certainly for me, this is always a chance to reflect on my own faith journey.\'a0 Many times as President, I\'92ve been reminded of a line of prayer that Eleanor Roosevelt was fond of. She said, \'93Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength.\'94\'a0 Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength.\'a0 I\'92ve wondered at times if maybe God was answering that prayer a little too literally.\'a0 But no matter the challenge, He has been there for all of us.\'a0 He\'92s certainly strengthened me \'93with the power through his Spirit,\'94 as I\'92ve sought His guidance not just in my own life but in the life of our nation.\
\'a0\
Now, over the last few months, we\'92ve seen a number of challenges -- certainly over the last six years.\'a0 But part of what I want to touch on today is the degree to which we've seen professions of faith used both as an instrument of great good, but also twisted and misused in the name of evil.\'a0\
As we speak, around the world, we see faith inspiring people to lift up one another -- to feed the hungry and care for the poor, and comfort the afflicted and make peace where there is strife.\'a0 We heard the good work that Sister has done in Philadelphia, and the incredible work that Dr. Brantly and his colleagues have done.\'a0 We see faith driving us to do right.\
But we also see faith being twisted and distorted, used as a wedge -- or, worse, sometimes used as a weapon.\'a0 From a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for faith, their faith, professed to stand up for Islam, but, in fact, are betraying it.\'a0 We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death cult that, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism\'a0 -- terrorizing religious minorities like the Yezidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.\'a0\
We see sectarian war in Syria, the murder of Muslims and Christians in Nigeria, religious war in the Central African Republic, a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes in Europe, so often perpetrated in the name of religion.\
So how do we, as people of faith, reconcile these realities -- the profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, operating alongside those who seek to hijack religious for their own murderous ends?\'a0\
Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history.\'a0 And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.\'a0 In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.\'a0 Michelle and I returned from India -- an incredible, beautiful country, full of magnificent diversity -- but a place where, in past years, religious faiths of all types have, on occasion, been targeted by other peoples of faith, simply due to their heritage and their beliefs -- acts of intolerance that would have shocked Gandhiji, the person who helped to liberate that nation.\'a0\
So this is not unique to one group or one religion.\'a0 There is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency that can pervert and distort our faith.\'a0 In today\'92s world, when hate groups have their own Twitter accounts and bigotry can fester in hidden places in cyberspace, it can be even harder to counteract such intolerance. But God compels us to try.\'a0 And in this mission, I believe there are a few principles that can guide us, particularly those of us who profess to believe.\'a0\
And, first, we should start with some basic humility.\'a0 I believe that the starting point of faith is some doubt -- not being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right and that God speaks only to us, and doesn\'92t speak to others, that God only cares about us and doesn\'92t care about others, that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth.\'a0\
Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of truth -- our job is to be true to Him, His word, and His commandments.\'a0 And we should assume humbly that we\'92re confused and don\'92t always know what we\'92re doing and we\'92re staggering and stumbling towards Him, and have some humility in that process.\'a0 And that means we have to speak up against those who would misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or hatred with that fierce certainty.\'a0 No God condones terror.\'a0 No grievance justifies the taking of innocent lives, or the oppression of those who are weaker or fewer in number.\
And so, as people of faith, we are summoned to push back against those who try to distort our religion -- any religion -- for their own nihilistic ends.\'a0 And here at home and around the world, we will constantly reaffirm that fundamental freedom -- freedom of religion -- the right to practice our faith how we choose, to change our faith if we choose, to practice no faith at all if we choose, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.\
There\'92s wisdom in our founders writing in those documents that help found this nation the notion of freedom of religion, because they understood the need for humility.\'a0 They also understood the need to uphold freedom of speech, that there was a connection between freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\'a0 For to infringe on one right under the pretext of protecting another is a betrayal of both.\'a0\
But part of humility is also recognizing in modern, complicated, diverse societies, the functioning of these rights, the concern for the protection of these rights calls for each of us to exercise civility and restraint and judgment.\'a0 And if, in fact, we defend the legal right of a person to insult another\'92s religion, we\'92re equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults -- (applause) -- and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with religious communities, particularly religious minorities who are the targets of such attacks.\'a0 Just because you have the right to say something doesn\'92t mean the rest of us shouldn\'92t question those who would insult others in the name of free speech.\'a0 Because we know that our nations are stronger when people of all faiths feel that they are welcome, that they, too, are full and equal members of our countries.\
So humility I think is needed.\'a0 And the second thing we need is to uphold the distinction between our faith and our governments.\'a0 Between church and between state.\'a0 The United States is one of the most religious countries in the world -- far more religious than most Western developed countries.\'a0 And one of the reasons is that our founders wisely embraced the separation of church and state.\'a0 Our government does not sponsor a religion, nor does it pressure anyone to practice a particular faith, or any faith at all.\'a0 And the result is a culture where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely and proudly worship, without fear, or coercion -- so that when you listen to Darrell talk about his faith journey you know it's real.\'a0 You know he\'92s not saying it because it helps him advance, or because somebody told him to.\'a0 It's from the heart.\'a0\'a0\'a0\
That\'92s not the case in theocracies that restrict people\'92s choice of faith.\'a0 It's not the case in authoritarian governments that elevate an individual leader or a political party above the people, or in some cases, above the concept of God Himself.\'a0 So the freedom of religion is a value we will continue to protect here at home and stand up for around the world, and is one that we guard vigilantly here in the United States.\
Last year, we joined together to pray for the release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, held in North Korea for two years.\'a0 And today, we give thanks that Kenneth is finally back where he belongs -- home, with his family.\'a0 (Applause.)\
Last year, we prayed together for Pastor Saeed Abedini, detained in Iran since 2012.\'a0 And I was recently in Boise, Idaho, and had the opportunity to meet with Pastor Abedini\'92s beautiful wife and wonderful children and to convey to them that our country has not forgotten brother Saeed and that we\'92re doing everything we can to bring him home.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0 And then, I received an extraordinary letter from Pastor Abedini.\'a0 And in it, he describes his captivity, and expressed his gratitude for my visit with his family, and thanked us all for standing in solidarity with him during his captivity.\
And Pastor Abedini wrote, \'93Nothing is more valuable to the Body of Christ than to see how the Lord is in control, and moves ahead of countries and leadership through united prayer.\'94\'a0 And he closed his letter by describing himself as \'93prisoner for Christ, who is proud to be part of this great nation of the United States of America that cares for religious freedom around the world.\'94\'a0 (Applause.)\
We\'92re going to keep up this work -- for Pastor Abedini and all those around the world who are unjustly held or persecuted because of their faith.\'a0\'a0 And we\'92re grateful to our new Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Rabbi David Saperstein -- who has hit the ground running, and is heading to Iraq in a few days to help religious communities there address some of those challenges.\'a0 Where\'92s David?\'a0 I know he\'92s here somewhere.\'a0 Thank you, David, for the great work you\'92re doing.\'a0 (Applause.)\
Humility; a suspicion of government getting between us and our faiths, or trying to dictate our faiths, or elevate one faith over another.\'a0 And, finally, let\'92s remember that if there is one law that we can all be most certain of that seems to bind people of all faiths, and people who are still finding their way towards faith but have a sense of ethics and morality in them -- that one law, that Golden Rule that we should treat one another as we wish to be treated.\'a0 The Torah says \'93Love thy neighbor as yourself.\'94\'a0 In Islam, there is a Hadith that states: "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\'94\'a0 The Holy Bible tells us to \'93put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.\'94\'a0 Put on love.\
Whatever our beliefs, whatever our traditions, we must seek to be instruments of peace, and bringing light where there is darkness, and sowing love where there is hatred.\'a0 And this is the loving message of His Holiness, Pope Francis.\'a0 And like so many people around the world, I\'92ve been touched by his call to relieve suffering, and to show justice and mercy and compassion to the most vulnerable; to walk with The Lord and ask \'93Who am I to judge?\'94\'a0 He challenges us to press on in what he calls our \'93march of living hope.\'94\'a0 And like millions of Americans, I am very much looking forward to welcoming Pope Francis to the United States later this year.\'a0 (Applause.)\
His Holiness expresses that basic law:\'a0 Treat thy neighbor as yourself.\'a0 The Dalai Lama -- anybody who\'92s had an opportunity to be with him senses that same spirit.\'a0 Kent Brantly expresses that same spirit.\'a0 Kent was with Samaritan\'92s Purse, treating Ebola patients in Liberia, when he contracted the virus himself. And with world-class medical care and a deep reliance on faith -- with God\'92s help, Kent survived.\'a0 (Applause.)\'a0\
And then by donating his plasma, he helped others survive as well.\'a0 And he continues to advocate for a global response in West Africa, reminding us that \'93our efforts needs to be on loving the people there.\'94\'a0 And I could not have been prouder to welcome Kent and his wonderful wife Amber to the Oval Office.\'a0 We are blessed to have him here today -- because he reminds us of what it means to really \'93love thy neighbor as thyself.\'94\'a0 Not just words, but deeds.\'a0\
Each of us has a role in fulfilling our common, greater purpose -- not merely to seek high position, but to plumb greater depths so that we may find the strength to love more fully.\'a0 And this is perhaps our greatest challenge -- to see our own reflection in each other; to be our brother\'92s keepers and sister\'92s keepers, and to keep faith with one another.\'a0 As children of God, let\'92s make that our work, together.\
As children of God, let\'92s work to end injustice -- injustice of poverty and hunger.\'a0 No one should ever suffer from such want amidst such plenty.\'a0 As children of God, let\'92s work to eliminate the scourge of homelessness, because, as Sister Mary says, \'93None of us are home until all of us are home.\'94\'a0 None of us are home until all of us are home.\
As children of God, let\'92s stand up for the dignity and value of every woman, and man, and child, because we are all equal in His eyes, and work to send the scourge and the sin of modern-day slavery and human trafficking, and \'93set the oppressed free.\'94\'a0 (Applause.)\
If we are properly humble, if we drop to our knees on occasion, we will acknowledge that we never fully know God\'92s purpose.\'a0 We can never fully fathom His amazing grace.\'a0 \'93We see through a glass, darkly\'94 -- grappling with the expanse of His awesome love.\'a0 But even with our limits, we can heed that which is required:\'a0 To do justice, and love kindness, and walk humbly with our God.\
I pray that we will.\'a0 And as we journey together on this \'93march of living hope,\'94 I pray that, in His name, we will run and not be weary, and walk and not be faint, and we\'92ll heed those words and \'93put on love.\'94\'a0\
May the Lord bless you and keep you, and may He bless this precious country that we love.\'a0\
Thank you all very much.\'a0\

\fs40 \cf2 \cb3 Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\cb1 \
\cb3 Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our Union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle.\cb1 \
\cb3 It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our Union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one Nation, as one people. Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.\cb1 \
\cb3 One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a Government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted, immediately and aggressively. And 1 year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\cb1 \
\cb3 But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life's become that much harder.\cb1 \
\cb3 This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades: the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.\cb1 \
\cb3 So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years, in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.\cb1 \
\cb3 For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated, some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.\cb1 \
\cb3 So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope, what they deserve, is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.\cb1 \
\cb3 And you know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, "We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged."\cb1 \
\cb3 It's because of this spirit, this great decency and great strength, that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our Union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a Government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength. And tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.\cb1 \
\cb3 It begins with our economy. Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. I hated it; you hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular; I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.\cb1 \
\cb3 So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks\'97most but not all.\cb1 \
\cb3 To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea. But if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed. That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time home buyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. I thought I'd get some applause on that one.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person\'97not a single dime.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. Two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy. Three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first-responders. And we're on track to add another 1\'bd million jobs to this total by the end of the year.\cb1 \
\cb3 The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill. Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster. But you don't have to take their word for it. Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act. Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created. Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all.\cb1 \
\cb3 There are stories like this all across America. And after 2 years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.\cb1 \
\cb3 But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses. I agree, absolutely. But Government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss. Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession, and they're ready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even those that are making a profit.\cb1 \
\cb3 So tonight I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I'm also proposing a new small business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.\cb1 \
\cb3 Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our Nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products. Tomorrow I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our Nation's goods, services, and information.\cb1 \
\cb3 We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will. People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.\cb1 \
\cb3 But the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last 2 years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.\cb1 \
\cb3 We can't afford another so-called economic "expansion" like the one from the last decade, what some call the "lost decade," where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.\cb1 \
\cb3 From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while. For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?\cb1 \
\cb3 You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany's not waiting. India's not waiting. These nations are\'97they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs. Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America. As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.\cb1 \
\cb3 We need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes, and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. But we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.\cb1 \
\cb3 Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the California business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.\cb1 \
\cb3 But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. And that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear powerplants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America. Now, I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. And this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.\cb1 \
\cb3 I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But here's the thing: Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.\cb1 \
\cb3 Third, we need to export more of our goods, because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next 5 years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.\cb1 \
\cb3 We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea and Panama and Colombia.\cb1 \
\cb3 Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. Now, this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city. In the 21st century, the best antipoverty program around is a world-class education. And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 States.\cb1 \
\cb3 Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.\cb1 \
\cb3 To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase Pell grants. And let's tell another 1 million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years\'97and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college. And by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year, I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle class families. That's why we're nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.\cb1 \
\cb3 And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform. Yes, we do.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, let's clear a few things up. I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics. I took on health care because of the stories I've heard from Americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.\cb1 \
\cb3 After nearly a century of trying\'97Democratic administrations, Republican administrations\'97we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care.\cb1 \
\cb3 And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. Thank you, honey. She gets embarrassed.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.\cb1 \
\cb3 Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most Americans wondering, "What's in it for me?"\cb1 \
\cb3 But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this Chamber.\cb1 \
\cb3 So, as temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Let me know. Let me know. I'm eager to see it.\cb1 \
\cb3 Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing. So let me start the discussion of Government spending by setting the record straight.\cb1 \
\cb3 At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a 1-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Now\'97just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis. And our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That too is a fact.\cb1 \
\cb3 I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The Federal Government should do the same. So tonight I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.\cb1 \
\cb3 Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze Government spending for 3 years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary Government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.\cb1 \
\cb3 We will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we'll extend our middle class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That's why I've called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, yesterday the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission, so I'll issue an Executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze Government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works. But understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.\cb1 \
\cb3 From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is, that's what we did for 8 years. That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.\cb1 \
\cb3 Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense\'97a novel concept.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years. To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the Government they deserve.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, that's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts on\'97our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on Federal boards and commissions. But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client, with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for Federal office.\cb1 \
\cb3 With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.\cb1 \
\cb3 I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicans\'97Democrats and Republicans. Look, you've trimmed some of this spending, you've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some Members of Congress post some earmark requests online. Tonight I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and\'97some postpartisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.\cb1 \
\cb3 But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of\'97I'm speaking to both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators.\cb1 \
\cb3 Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our Government. So, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.\cb1 \
\cb3 To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town\'97a supermajority\'97then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let's show the American people that we can do it together.\cb1 \
\cb3 This week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.\'a0\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in relitigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our Nation and forge a more hopeful future for America and for the world.\cb1 \
\cb3 That's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we've renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our Nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaida's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.\cb1 \
\cb3 And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely confident we will succeed.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we take the fight to Al Qaida, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi Government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tonight all of our men and women in uniform, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world, they have to know that we\'97that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home. That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year. That's why we're building a 21st century VA. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, DC, behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They too will face growing consequences. That is a promise.\cb1 \
\cb3 That's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease, a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity\'97always.\cb1 \
\cb3 Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: The notion that we're all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else.\cb1 \
\cb3 We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right thing to do.\cb1 \
\cb3 We're going to crackdown on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work. And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our Nation.\cb1 \
\cb3 In the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe, values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit. These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor values, they're American values.\cb1 \
\cb3 Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions\'97our corporations, our media, and, yes, our Government\'97still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away. No wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment.\cb1 \
\cb3 I campaigned on the promise of change. Change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change or that I can deliver it.\cb1 \
\cb3 But remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.\cb1 \
\cb3 Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election, instead of doing what's best for the next generation.\cb1 \
\cb3 But I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do what it took to keep the dream of this Nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on.\cb1 \
\cb3 It lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of his company, "None of us," he said," . . . are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail." It lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, "We are strong. We are resilient. We are American." It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti. And it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of "U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!" when another life was saved.\cb1 \
\cb3 The spirit that has sustained this Nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our Union once more.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.\cb1 \
\cb3 So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.\cb1 \
\cb3 That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.\cb1 \
\cb3 These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land\'97a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.\cb1 \
\cb3 Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America\'97they will be met.\cb1 \
\cb3 On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.\cb1 \
\cb3 On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.\cb1 \
\cb3 We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.\cb1 \
\cb3 In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted\'97for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things\'97some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\cb1 \
\cb3 For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.\cb1 \
\cb3 For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.\cb1 \
\cb3 For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.\cb1 \
\cb3 Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.\cb1 \
\cb3 This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions\'97that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.\cb1 \
\cb3 For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act\'97not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.\cb1 \
\cb3 Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions\'97who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.\cb1 \
\cb3 What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them\'97that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works\'97whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account\'97to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day\'97because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.\cb1 \
\cb3 Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control\'97and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart\'97not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.\cb1 \
\cb3 As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.\cb1 \
\cb3 Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.\cb1 \
\cb3 We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort\'97even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.\cb1 \
\cb3 For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.\cb1 \
\cb3 To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\cb1 \
\cb3 To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.\cb1 \
\cb3 As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment\'97a moment that will define a generation\'97it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.\cb1 \
\cb3 For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.\cb1 \
\cb3 Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends\'97hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism\'97these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility\'97a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.\cb1 \
\cb3 This is the price and the promise of citizenship.\cb1 \
\cb3 This is the source of our confidence\'97the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.\cb1 \
\cb3 This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed\'97why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\cb1 \
\cb3 So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:\cb1 \
\cb3 "Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]."\cb1 \
\cb3 America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.}
